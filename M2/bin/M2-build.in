# This version of the M2 script is useful while the program is being built.

# In the case where DUMPDATA=no, it's able to find all the *.m2 files 
# needed, even though they are scattered between locations in the source
# directory tree and the build directory tree.

# But, since this script uses $0 to locate the other files, it will not work
# through a symbolic link.
