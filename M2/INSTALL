-------------------------------------------
Compiling on multiple machine architectures
-------------------------------------------

If multiple machine architectures are supported by your hardware and
operating system, a good way to specify which one to use is to use the
build option to autoconf's configure script with an architecture in
config.guess format.  This will work with gmp, for example, as it
knows how to produce the additional options to the compilers.

Example:

   ../configure --build=x86_64-apple-darwin

Another way to do it is to specify names for the compilers that
include the additional options for the architecture to be used.  That
will almost always work.

Example:

   ../configure CC="gcc -m64" CXX="g++ -m64"

Yet another way to do it is to add the architecture option to CFLAGS
and to CXXFLAGS.  The disadvantage of that approach is that the
package might have its own idea about what other options to use, which
would be ignored.

Example:

   ../configure CFLAGS="-O2 -m64" CXXFLAGS="-O2 -m64"

When using "capybara", you can take advantage of both good ways of
doing it, by putting something like the following code into the file
include/capybara/local-overrides.

    ARCHOPT = -m64
    ARCHITECTURE = x86_64-apple-darwin
    CONFIGOPTIONS += --build=$(ARCHITECTURE) CC="gcc $(ARCHOPT)" CXX="g++ $(ARCHOPT)"

Even that doesn't quite work when compiling a package, such as "gc",
that uses "libtool".  Unfortunately, libtool doesn't understand the
-m64 option, so it drops it.  The work-around is to create shell
scripts on your path called gcc-m64 and g++-m64 that can be used as
the compilers, and to use this instead:

    ARCHOPT = -m64
    ARCHITECTURE = x86_64-apple-darwin
    CONFIGOPTIONS += --build=$(ARCHITECTURE) CC="gcc$(ARCHOPT)" CXX="g++$(ARCHOPT)"

In the shell script gcc-m64 put this single line:

     exec gcc -m64 "$@"

In the shell script g++-m64 put this single line:

     exec g++ -m64 "$@"

---------
Programs
---------

Here are programs you may have to install on your system to build Macaulay 2.

   program: fakeroot
    get at: http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/fakeroot
     notes: You need this only if you intend to make a debian distribution
            package for Macaulay2.

   program: rpmbuild
     notes: needed only if you want to make an rpm distribution file

----------------------
Getting the source code
----------------------

The best way to get the source code is to download a tar file from our web site
that contains the source code corresponding to a major release.

To get the very latest source code (which may not always work):

	svn export svn://u123.math.uiuc.edu/macaulay2/trunk/M2
	cd M2
	make

The "make" command above runs the commands "autoconf" and "autoheader", which
create the "configure" script and the "include/config.h.in" file.

-----------------------
Compiling
-----------------------

Quick and easy:

	./configure --disable-encap
	make
	make check			# optional
	make install

The script "configure" is made by autoconf, and we support the
standard features, such as compilation in a separate build directory,
as much as possible.

By default, the files are installed in appropriate subdirectories of
/usr/local.  To specify a different location (prefix) replace the last
command above by something like this

	make prefix=/foo/bar install

In that case, files will be installed in the following directories:

	/foo/bar/bin
	/foo/bar/share/Macaulay2
	/foo/bar/share/doc/Macaulay2
	/foo/bar/share/man/man1
	/foo/bar/share/emacs/site-lisp
	/foo/bar/lib/Macaulay2

To make an encapsulated directory tree or distribution tarball
suitable for use with the program epkg (see
http://www.encap.org/epkg/), replace the configuration command with:

	./configure

The effect is to insert one more component into the path names used at
installation time, so that in response to 

	make prefix=/foo/bar install

files will be installed in the following directories:

	/foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/bin
	/foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/Macaulay2
	/foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/doc/Macaulay2
	/foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/man/man1
	/foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/emacs/site-lisp
	/foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/lib/Macaulay2

Each * above is replaced by the current version number.  There will
also be a few extra files placed in the directory /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*
which instruct epkg how to make appropriate symbolic links to install
our program, and how to initialize the dumped data file.

To use a different prefix, say /mnt/local, for finding libraries and include
files installed in a nonstandard location:

	../configure LDFLAGS=-L/mnt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/mnt/local/include ...

where ... represents the remaining arguments, as above.  As an example, if
you have compiled the libraries with fink, then you could use this line:

        ../configure LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include ...

To specify libraries to link against during configuration, use the
LIBS environment variable, as described in documentation for autoconf.
Example:

	../configure LIBS=-lfoo ...

To see descriptions of all the environment variables that influence
configuration, run this command and look at the section of the output
entitled "Some influential environment variables":

	../configure --help

The only one of these variables with a nonempty default value is
CFLAGS, and its default value is "-g -O2".  That will be supplanted if
you override it.

Microsoft Windows XP and Vista notes
-----------------------

    ----------------------
    Cygwin
    ----------------------

    Notes:

      - Some configure scripts, notably that of "libtool", assume ccp is in /lib
        on every system.  Work around:

	   ln -s /usr/bin/cpp /lib

Linux notes
----------------------

----------------------
MacOS X notes
----------------------

There are several methods for installing Macaulay2 under Mac OS X.

(1) Download the ppc or i386 disk images and follow the directions in
    the read me file.  This is the easiest and fastest method.

(2) Use the fink system (http://fink.sourceforge.net).

    Follow the instructions at the Fink website to install Fink itself,
    add unstable/main to the appropriate line in /sw/etc/fink.conf, and
    then install Fink's "macaulay2" package.  You can choose the binary
    installation method or the source installation method (which will
    download the source files and compile them on your machine).  You may
    also wish to install emacs or xemacs using Fink, for the best
    interface to Macaulay2.

    Fink can also be used to install other software of interest to
    mathematicians, and is highly recommended. 

(3) Build from source yourself.  
    
    The following are the steps we take to build a binary disk image for
    Macaulay2.  First, you must have installed the developer tools from apple:
    use either the packages that are on your system install DVD, or download
    from http://connect.apple.com.

    The script below downloads gc, gdbm, gmp, readline, ntl, factory and
    libfac, builds them, and then builds Macaulay2.  The libraries are
    statically linked in, to make installation simpler for most people.

    To make a 64 bit (intel) distribution disk image:

	  svn co svn://Macaulay2.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/trunk/M2 M2
	  cd M2
	  make
	  mkdir BUILD/opt64
	  cd BUILD/opt64
	  ../../configure --prefix=$PWD/installed \
                --enable-dmg \
                --enable-build-libraries="gc gdbm gmp readline ntl factory libfac" \
		--build=x86_64-apple-darwin \
		CC="gcc -m64" \
		CXX="g++ -m64"
          make
	  make install
	  # now there is a dmg file in BUILD/opt64
	  make check # optional, but recommended

   To make a 32 bit version (intel or ppc), use this instead:

	  svn co svn://Macaulay2.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/trunk/M2 M2
	  cd M2
	  make
	  mkdir BUILD/opt32
	  cd BUILD/opt32
	  ../../configure --prefix=$PWD/installed \
                --enable-dmg \
                --enable-build-libraries="gc gdbm gmp mpfr readline ntl factory libfac"
          make
	  make install
	  # now there is a dmg file in BUILD/opt32
	  make check # optional, but recommended

    To make a 64 bit (intel) debug version:

	  svn co svn://Macaulay2.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/trunk/M2 M2
	  cd M2
	  make
	  mkdir BUILD/debug64
	  cd BUILD/debug64
	  ../../configure --prefix=$PWD/installed \
	        --enable-debug --disable-optimize \
                --enable-build-libraries="gc gdbm gmp mpfr readline ntl factory libfac" \
		--build=x86_64-apple-darwin \
		CC="gcc -m64" \
		CXX="g++ -m64"
          make
	  make install
	  make check # optional, but recommended

    To make a 64 bit (intel) profile version (for use with gprof, and other tools):

	  svn co svn://Macaulay2.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/trunk/M2 M2
	  cd M2
	  make
	  mkdir BUILD/profile64
	  cd BUILD/profile64
	  ../../configure --prefix=$PWD/installed \
	        --enable-profile \
                --enable-build-libraries="gc gdbm gmp mpfr readline ntl factory libfac" \
		--build=x86_64-apple-darwin \
		CC="gcc -m64" \
		CXX="g++ -m64"
          make
	  make install

-------------------------------
-- Ubuntu linux, from source --
-------------------------------

Here are the steps to take a newly installed ubuntu 7.10 system (64 bit),
and to get Macaulay2 running (either via an ubuntu package or via source.

From the package file:

     You may prepare for installing Macaulay 2 (with apt-get, gdebi-gtk, or the
     Synaptic Package Manager) by adding the following line to the file
     /etc/apt/sources.list:

         deb http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Repositories/Debian stable main

     One way to add this line to that file is with the Synaptic Package
     Manager. Pull down the "Settings" menu, and select "Repositories".

     You may see a tab labelled "Third Party Software" (for example, under
     Debian). Click on it, then click on "Add", and add the entry. If you make
     a mistake, be prepared to use an editor to edit the file to correct it.

     Alternatively, you may see a tab labelled "Installation Media" (for
     example, under Debian 4.0). Click on it, then click on "Add" and then
     "Custom", and add the entry.

     Having added the line, now reload the package lists from the repositories
     (i.e., click on the "Reload" button) and then click on the Mathematics
     (Math) section. You should see "macaulay2" on the list, available for
     download. (The package manager will consult
     http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Repositories/Debian/dists/.)

     Another way to install Macaulay 2, after those lines are added to
     /etc/apt/sources.list, is with this command line.

	sudo apt-get install macaulay2

From source:

     Install required packages (via the command line, as here, or via the
     synaptic package manager):

     	     sudo apt-get install ...

     Now grab, configure, compile and install Macaulay2:

	  svn co svn://Macaulay2.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/trunk/M2 M2
	  cd M2; make
	  mkdir BUILD/opt64; cd BUILD/opt64
	  ../../configure
          make
	  make install # places M2 into /usr/local
	  make check # optional, but recommended
