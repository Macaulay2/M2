We thank the United States National Science Foundation for generous funding
to develop Macaulay2.

We permit you to use the source code under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL), version 2 or 3, as published by the Free Software Foundation;

version 3.

This is free software.  There is no warranty; not even for merchantability or
fitness for a particular purpose.

This file describes how to build the software from sources and is not included
in binary distributions.  Most users will prefer to download a binary
distribution.

----------------------
Getting the source code
----------------------

The current development version of the source code can be obtained with this
command, assuming you have installed "git" on your machine:

    git clone https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2

A directory called M2, which you can move or rename, will be created, and this
INSTALL file is in the subdirectory "M2" of it.  The "release" branches tend to
be more stable, and if you compile from one of those, you'll have the same
functionality as those who download our binary releases.  So, after cloning,
you can switch to the branch containing version 1.6, for example, with the
following command:

    git checkout release-1.6

Instead of release-1.6 you should, of course, use the most recent one.

The following command shows the list of release branches:

    git branch -a | grep origin/release

The following commands will download the latest changes to the source code:

    git pull
    git submodule update

---------
Programs
---------

Here are programs you may have to install on your system to build Macaulay2.

   program: fakeroot
    get at: http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/fakeroot
     notes: You need this only if you intend to make a debian distribution
            package for Macaulay2.

   program: rpmbuild
     notes: needed only if you want to make an rpm distribution file

---------
Libraries
---------

Here are some libraries you may have to install on your system to build
Macaulay2.  If your operating system distinguishes between development
versions and run-time versions of the libraries, you will need the development
version.

Here are commands that will get you a good development environment under
various modern operating systems:

  Debian:
    Install packages with:
      sudo apt-get install -y -q autoconf bison curl emacs flex g++ gcc gfortran libboost-dev libc6-dev libcdd-dev libgc-dev libgdbm-dev libglpk-dev libgmp3-dev liblapack-dev liblzma-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev libntl-dev libpari-dev libreadline-dev libtool libxml2-dev libz-dev make openssh-server pkg-config subversion xbase-clients unzip pinentry-curses libmpc-dev
    On a 32-bit system, add
        --with-mpir-config-options="ABI=32 --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu"
      to the "configure" command line below.  (The --build option is necessary
      only to enable distribution of the resulting binaries to users of other
      hardware.) 

  Ubuntu:
    Install packages with:
      sudo apt-get install -y -q autoconf bison emacs flex g++ gcc gfortran libc6-dev libcdd-dev libatomic-ops-dev libgc-dev libgdbm-dev libglpk-dev liblapack-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses-dev libncurses5-dev libntl-dev libpari-dev libreadline-dev libxml2-dev liblzma-dev libz-dev make openssh-server patch subversion time unzip xbase-clients zlib1g-dev libtool pkg-config libmpc-dev
        # note: libz-dev seems to have been replaced by zlib1g-dev
        # note: libncurses-dev seems to have been replaced by libncurses5-dev
        # note: libreadline-gplv2-dev is an older GPL v2 version of libreadline
    On all systems, add
        FC=gfortran
      to the environment or to the "configure" command line below.  (The
      program "make" has a default value of "f77" for "FC", the Fortran
      compiler, but "f77" isn't available.)
    On a 32-bit system, add
        --with-mpir-config-options="ABI=32 --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu"
      to the "configure" command line below.  (The --build option is necessary
      only to enable distribution of the resulting binaries to users of other
      hardware.) 
    On Ubuntu 14.10 and later, add
        --enable-build-libraries=pari
      to the "configure" command line below.  (The version of pari possibly installed there
      will crash when M2 exits.)
    (To upgrade to a new release of Ubuntu, run "update-manager" if you want a GUI, or run
    "do-release-upgrade" for a command line interface.)

  Raspbian:
    Install packages with:
      sudo apt-get install -y -q autoconf bison curl emacs flex g++ gcc gfortran libc6-dev libcdd-dev libgc-dev libgdbm-dev libglpk-dev libgmp3-dev liblapack-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses-dev libntl-dev libpari-dev libreadline-dev libxml2-dev libz-dev make openssh-server subversion xbase-clients time libtool
    On a 32-bit system, add
        --with-mpir-config-options="ABI=32 --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu"
      to the "configure" command line below.  (The --build option is necessary
      only to enable distribution of the resulting binaries to users of other
      hardware.) 
    The Raspberry Pi comes with 512MB of RAM and a swapfile /var/swap of size 100MB.  It's a good idea to
     increase the swap size to 1000MB by editing /etc/dphys-swapfile .

  Fedora:
    Install packages with:
      sudo yum -y install autoconf bison boost-devel cddlib-devel emacs factory-devel fakeroot flex gc-devel gcc-c++ gdbm-devel git glpk-devel gmp-devel kernel-devel lapack-devel libatomic_ops-devel libfac-devel libgfortran-static libtool libxml2-devel mpfr-devel mpir-devel ncurses-devel ntl-devel pari-devel patch readline-devel rpm-build rpm-sign rpmdevtools subversion libmpc-devel
    Some debugging aids:
      sudo debuginfo-install strace

  Scientific linux:
    Install packages with: (SL 7.x)
      sudo yum install -y autoconf bison boost-devel emacs flex gc-devel gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran gdbm-devel glpk-devel gmp-devel lapack-devel libatomic_ops-devel  libtool libxml2-devel mpfr-devel ncurses-devel readline-devel rpm-build rpm-sign git-all zlib-devel xz-devel libmpc-devel time
    Some debugging aids:
      sudo yum install -y strace
    Note: Scientific Linux 7.1 has a modern version of gcc (version 4.8.3).  By contrast,
      Scientific Linux 6.5 has an old version (4.4.7) of gcc that may not work with a
      future version of Macaulay2.  However, one can install newer compilers
      (4.8.2) from the repository of the "Scientific Linux CERN 6" distribution,
      (see http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/devtoolset/) using the following commands.
	  wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/slc6-devtoolset.repo http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/devtoolset/slc6-devtoolset.repo
	  yum install devtoolset-2-gcc devtoolset-2-gcc-g++ devtoolset-2-gcc-gfortran devtoolset-2-binutils
      Then use
	  . /opt/rh/devtoolset-2/enable
      to update the environment of your currently running shell.  The latter
      command will also work in your shell initialization file, ".profile".

  Suse Linux Leap 42.1:

    sudo zypper -n install man man-pages emacs-x11 gcc git screen autoconf bison createrepo emacs flex gc-devel gcc gcc-c++ gcc-fortran gdbm-devel gmp-devel lapack-devel libxml2-devel make mpfr-devel ncurses-devel patch readline-devel subversion zlib-devel libtool libatomic_ops-devel libmpir-devel mpfr-devel pari-devel ntl-devel flint-devel glpk-devel cddlib-devel givaro-devel boost-devel rpm-build mpc-devel

    Add

       --enable-build-libraries="givaro"

    to the configure command line, since the givaro installed above has bugs that cause compile time errors.  Add also

       --enable-rpm --build=x86_64-suse-gnu

    to make RPM files for distribution to generic hardware.

  Arch Linux:
    You may prefer to use the Arch package for Macaulay2 at https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/macaulay2/.
    For compiling it yourself:
      sudo pacman --sync --needed archlinux-keyring
      sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux
      sudo pacman --sync --needed autoconf automake bison boost cddlib emacs flex flint gc gcc gcc-fortran gdbm gfan git givaro glpk gmp gtest lapack make mpfr nauty ntl pkg-config readline texinfo time unzip
    We recommend adding
    	 --enable-build-libraries="pari flint ntl gc givaro"
      to the "configure" command line below in the section on compiling Macaulay2
      Adding "gc" here seems to avoid undiagnosed problems with invalid libgc pointers.
      Adding "givaro" here ensures that we don't get the incompatible newer version 4.0 of givaro.
    To upgrade the system:
      sudo pacman --sync --refresh --sysupgrade
    Compilation doesn't succeed with gcc 6, so install gcc 5 with
      sudo pacman --sync --needed gcc5
    and add "CC=gcc-5 CXX=g++-5" to the "configure" command line below.  (We succeeded with gcc 5.4.0.)

  Mac OS X:
    The steps described below are combined in the shell script INSTALL.mac, which you could
      simply run instead.
    Install the Xcode Command Line Tools, available from Apple.  One may use
      the following command for installing it:
      	 xcode-select --install
      After upgrading the OS, it will be necessary to install it again.  (One symptom of
      forgetting to do this is that /usr/include may be missing.)
    Optionally install a good version of emacs, such as the one available from 
      http://emacsformacosx.com/, which is a native Mac OS X port of emacs. To
      run it from the command line, create an executable shell script called 
      "emacs" with this line in it:
        exec /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs "$@"
    Install "homebrew", available from http://brew.sh/.  (Experts who want to install
      homebrew somewhere other than in /usr/local may prefer to point a browser
      at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tarball/master, which will download
      a tar file that can be untarred anywhere and renamed.)
    Install the programs and libraries needed for building:
	brew tap homebrew/versions
	brew tap homebrew/science
	brew tap homebrew/homebrew-x11
	brew update
	brew install gcc49 pkg-config autoconf automake gnu-tar libtool boost libmpc xz
    Periodically upgrade the programs and libraries to the latest versions with
	brew update
        brew upgrade
    Next, if intending to distribute the Macaulay2 binaries to others, do:
	brew install --build-from-source --cc=gcc-4.9 bdw-gc libatomic_ops gdbm gmp cddlib glpk
      else do:    
	brew install bdw-gc libatomic_ops gdbm gmp cddlib glpk
    Note: the libraries pari and flint are also available from homebrew, but we build them
      ourselves.
    Note: the reason we compile from source with gcc is that the precompiled
      packages that brew would otherwise download are compiled using "clang"
      and assume that the CPU supports advanced vector extensions, which not
      all of the machines of our users do.
    Now remember to add 
        --enable-build-libraries="pari flint readline" CC="gcc-4.9" CXX="g++-4.9"
      to the "configure" command line below in the section on compiling Macaulay2.
    Note: including "readline" in the "--enable-build-libraries" option is
      necessary because it doesn't seem to be possible to recompile it from
      source; the binary distribution used by homebrew uses "clang", which will
      optimize the code in "gc" for your particular CPU.  If you won't be
      distributing the code to others, it can be omitted.
    Note: under Mac OS version 10.10 (Yosemite), the test for whether compiling with
      g++-4.9 and then linking with gcc-4.9 works may fail, in which case adding
        MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9
      to the environment (e.g., with the "sh" command
        export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9
      ) may help.  Apparently the tools have trouble determining that 10.10 is a
      newer version number than 10.9.  Linking alternatively with libgcc_eh
      seems to break C++ exception handling.
    Note: homebrew uses /usr/bin/gcc to compile its libraries.  If compiling
      with clang instead of gcc, then run this first:
        brew install gmp mpfr
    Note: software installed by "fink", if not kept up to date, can interfere
      with the Macaulay2 build process.  To test, for example, whether the
      correct version of "automake" is available, run the shell command
        type automake
      and expect to see /usr/local/bin/automake, as opposed to
      /sw/bin/automake.  Since homebrew suffices for most purposes, it's
      probably best to just remove fink entirely, with the command
        sudo rm -rf /sw

  Cygwin 1.7 under Microsoft Windows:
    Use setup to install these packages:
	autoconf automake bison emacs-X11 file flex gcc-core gcc-fortran
	gcc-g++ git libatomic_ops-devel libboost-devel libgc-devel
	libgdbm-devel libglpk-devel liblapack-devel libmpfr-devel
	libncurses-devel libreadline-devel libstdc++6-devel libtool
	libxml2-devel make patchutils pkg-config time unzip wget
    You may also want these:
        ctags emacs-el gdb gvim libxml2-doc openssh psmisc vim xauth xconsole
        xinit xkill xterm
    After installing xinit, the program "startxwin" can be used to start X Windows.

----------------------
  Compiling the most recent GNU C compiler
----------------------

  It may happen that you need a modern version of the GNU C compiler, but you
  have no way to download a binary distribution of it, or you have no way to
  use "brew" or "fink" to download and compile it for you.  In that case, you
  may download, compile, and install the GNU C compiler (without necessariy
  having root access) as follows.  Change "$HOME/local" below to the path to
  the directory where you want to install the files; if it's a directory not
  owned by you, prefix the "make install" command below with "sudo".

       wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.8.2/gcc-4.8.2.tar.bz2
       tar xjf gcc-4.8.2.tar.bz2
       cd gcc-4.8.2
       ./contrib/download_prerequisites
       cd ..
       mkdir gcc-4.8.2-build
       cd gcc-4.8.2-build
       ../gcc-4.8.2/configure --prefix=$HOME/local --program-suffix=-4.8.2 --enable-languages=c,c++,fortran --disable-multilib
       make
       make install

     Do not omit the language "fortran" from the list, even if the package
     "lapack-devel" is installed, as "gfortran" is consulted for the locations
     of its libraries, and it would be bad to have a mismatch.

     It might be possible to add --disable-libstdcxx to the "configure"
     command line above, allowing the resulting binaries to depend on the
     version of libstdc++ already installed on your system.

     The resulting compiler executables will be named gcc-4.8.2 and g++-4.8.2.
     Now put the following lines in your file $HOME/.profile :

        export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH
        export MANPATH=$HOME/local/share/man:$MANPATH
        export INFOPATH=$HOME/local/share/info:$INFOPATH
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib:$HOME/local/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export CC=gcc-4.8.2
        export CXX=g++-4.8.2
        export FC=gfortran-4.8.2

     and then log out and log in again (or source the file into your
     environment and continue in the same process or in daughter processes).

     Under Scientific Linux 6.4, if you run "sudo yum install -y glibc-devel.i686"
     first, then you can omit --disable-multilib above and get a 32 bit
     compiler, too.  To see quickly which glibc architectures are installed,
     run "ls /usr/include/gnu/stubs-*.h".  (Parenthetically, we observe that to
     make /usr/bin/gcc successfully compile 32 bit binaries, one should also
     run "yum install -y libgcc.i686".)

     Any other libraries you may want to use may also be installed with
     $HOME/local as the install prefix, as gcc-4.8.2 will automatically search
     in there for include files and libraries.

     Installing multiple software in the same directory, such as in $HOME/local
     (as described above), makes it hard to remove or upgrade packages.  To
     solve that problem, use the program "epkg", available from
     http://www.encap.org/epkg/.

----------------------
Choosing a place for the repository
----------------------

A typical Macaulay2 build directory can use up 1.5GB of disk space, and in an
institutional environment your home directory is probably backed up to tape.
(You may do something similar on your own computers.)  Thus you can avoid an
unnecessary burden on your system administrator if you put the repository (or
at least the build directories) on a locally mounted scratch drive, where the
files are not backed up.  For your changes to Macaulay2 source code, github.com
will serve as your backup.

-----------------------
Building a fat source tarfile to avoid further downloads
-----------------------

It may be desirable when building Macaulay2 on multiple systems to create a
"fat" tarfile containing all of our source code as well as all of the source
code of the submodules and libraries that might later be used, to prevent later
access to the internt to obtain that source code.  To achieve that, do the
following:

  - Add the option "--recurse-submodules" to the 'git clone' command above.
    This populates the submodules' subdirectories with their source code.
  - Run :
       ./configure --enable-download
       make -C libraries fetch-all
       make distclean
    This fetches tar files containing the source code of all the libraries and
      deposits them in BUILD/tarfiles/.
  - When satisfied with the result, remove our git source repository with
      rm -rf ../.git
    Alternatively, tar up just this directory and not its parent directory.
    Everything needed to build Macaulay2 will be included.

-----------------------
Compiling Macaulay2
-----------------------

Now the directory to be in is the one containing this file in the source
distribution -- it is called "M2", and is a subdirectory of the top level
directory of the source tree.  If you are reading this file on the web, it may
be more convenient to switch now to reading it in its location in the source
tree.

Begin with this command:

        make

The "make" command above runs the commands "autoconf" and "autoheader", which
create the "configure" script and the "include/config.h.in" file, needed in the
next steps.  Once those files are created, it is not necessary to make them
again.  The "make" command on your system should be a recent version of GNU
make.

Now continue building the program this way:

        ./configure --enable-download
        make
        make check                      # optional
        make install

Remember to add any options specified above, in the section for your particular
operating system, to the "configure" command line.

To take advantage of parallelism when running "make", append an option of
the form "-jN" to the command line, where "N" is replaced by the number of
processors you wish to devote to the task.  (Our makefiles are just begining to
take advantage of this.)

To enable the running of the NTL "wizard", which conducts time consuming
experiments to optimize the speed of its code, before compiling it, add the
option --enable-ntl-wizard to the "configure" command line above.

By default, the files are installed in appropriate subdirectories of
/usr/local.  To specify a different location (prefix) you may use an option to
the configure script:

        ./configure --enable-download --prefix=/foo/bar

Files will then be installed in the following directories:

        /foo/bar/bin
        /foo/bar/share/Macaulay2
        /foo/bar/share/doc/Macaulay2
        /foo/bar/share/man/man1
        /foo/bar/share/emacs/site-lisp
        /foo/bar/lib/Macaulay2

instead of in

        /usr/local/bin
        /usr/local/share/Macaulay2
        /usr/local/share/doc/Macaulay2
        /usr/local/share/man/man1
        /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
        /usr/local/lib/Macaulay2

To use a different prefix, say $HOME/local, for finding libraries and include
files installed in a nonstandard location, add the following options to the
"configure" command line:
        LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/local/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include"
That step is unnecessary if the compiler was compiled from sources and installed
with that prefix.

To use a different compiler suite, such as gcc version 4.8.2 as compiled above,
add something like the following to the "configure" command line:
        CC=gcc-4.8.2 CXX=g++-4.8.2 FC=gfortran-4.8.2
That step is unnecessary if the environment variables CC and CXX are set as
described above.

To specify libraries to link against during configuration, use the LIBS
environment variable, as described in documentation for autoconf.  For example,
to link with libfoo, add the following option to the "configure" command line:

        LIBS=-lfoo

To see descriptions of all the environment variables that influence
configuration, run this command and look at the section of the output
entitled "Some influential environment variables":

        ./configure --help

The only one of these variables with a nonempty default value is
CFLAGS, and its default value is "-g -O2".  That will be supplanted if
you override it.

To specify a different installation location for the "make install" command you
may add an option to the "make install" line, as follows:

        make install prefix=/foo/bar

To make an encapsulated directory tree or distribution tarball suitable for use
with the program "epkg" (see http://www.encap.org/epkg/), add the option

        --enable-encap

to the "configure" command above.

The effect is to insert one more component into the path names used at
installation time, so that in response to 

        make prefix=/foo/bar install

files will be installed in the following directories:

        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/bin
        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/Macaulay2
        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/doc/Macaulay2
        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/man/man1
        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/share/emacs/site-lisp
        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/lib/Macaulay2

Each * above is replaced by the current version number.  There will
also be a few extra files placed in the directory /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*
which instruct epkg how to make appropriate symbolic links to install
our program, and how to initialize the dumped data file, if present:

        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/encapinfo
        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/postinstall
        /foo/bar/Macaulay2-*/preremove

-------------------------------------------
Compiling for multiple machine architectures
-------------------------------------------

By default, Macaulay2 will compile in such a way that it is adapted to the
architectural features of the CPU being used to do the compilation.  This is
especially true for the library mpir, which exploits many of the advanced
features of your CPU, determining them by running a small program and uses the
output from that to determine which optimization options (of the form
'-mtune=*' and '-march=*') to pass to gcc.

If you expect the Macaulay2 binary you build to run on other machines (for
example, if you are making a binary distribution to hand to others), then you
must prevent that from happening.

One way to do that is to pass an explicit "build target" to the configure
script, as in this example under Mac OS X:

   ./configure --build=x86_64-apple-darwin

The build target will be provided to the configure scripts of the libraries
needed, and, at least in the case of the mpir library, will prevent it from
optimizing further.

To find a suitable target, run :

   config/config.guess

To combine those two steps, run :

   ./configure --build=`config/config.guess`

----------------------
HTML validation
----------------------

To validate all our HTML files, run:

   make validate-html

This depends on the installation of the validator (e.g., the Ubuntu package
"w3c-markup-validator") and the script "validator-runner.py" from
http://github.com/ysangkok/w3c-validator-runner, so we don't run it
automatically.

----------------------
MacOS X notes
----------------------

    The standard gcc under Mac OS X is actually "clang", is based on LLVM, and
    has been buggy, so we compile the latest gcc or we use "brew" to install
    it, as described above.

    To build Macaulay2, add the option

        --build=x86_64-apple-darwin

    to the appropriate "configure" command line above, for else it will try to
    build a 32 bit version of Macaulay2.

    If you are using version 4.9 of gcc, as installed by homebrew, you should
    add

        CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9

    to the "configure" command line (or, better, to your environment setting in
    your .profile).  To sum up, your command line, with all those options, will
    look something like this:

        ./configure --enable-download --prefix=/foo/bar --build=x86_64-apple-darwin CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9

Rerunning the package examples
----------------------

Some packages cache their example output in the source code tree, since they
depend on the presence of external programs not included with Macaulay2.  Here
we briefly summarize them and the software they depend on:

    gfanInterface StatePolytope need polymake, builds OK
	    http://polymake.org/lib/exe/fetch.php/download/polymake-2.13-1.tar.bz2
	    (Make 3.81 has a problem with their makefile, so use 4.0)
	    Polymake can be installed under Ubuntu with the following command:
 	         sudo apt-get install polymake

    Bertini needs bertini:
	    http://www.nd.edu/~sommese/bertini/BertiniSource_v1.4.tar.gz
	which needs gmp and mpfr:
	    https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.0.0a.tar.xz
	    http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-3.1.2/mpfr-3.1.2.tar.xz

    PHCpack needs PHCpack, download the binary:
	    http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/x86_64phcv23p.tar.gz

    AdjointIdeal ConvexInterface MapleInterface Parametrization need Maple.

    ConvexInterface also needs the maple package "convex" installed.  See the 
    package documentation for hints about installing it.
    	    http://www.math.uwo.ca/~mfranz/convex/files/current/convex.m

----------------------
Warning messages
----------------------

	-  warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode

	   This message can be ignored, if the previous recursive make command
	   had -j1 as an option, as -j1 implies the use of just one processor,
	   anyway.  (We use -j1 as an option when compiling third party libraries
	   whose makefiles are not known to support parallelism.)

----------------------
Autoconf, autoreconf, libtool, ...
----------------------

If you get any mysterious error messages involving autoconf, autoreconf,
libtool, etc., try running

	 make -f Makefile get-tools

in the top level.  This command will install versions of those tools known to
work with Macaulay2.
