Libraries
---------

Here are the libraries you have to download and install on your system before
you can compile and link Macaulay 2.  We always compile with gcc, the latest
version, now 3.2.2.  It's a good idea to compile them in the order listed
here, as some of the later ones depend on some of the earlier ones.

    library: gc
    release: 6.1 (see file gc/version.h)
     author: Hans Boehm <hboehm@exch.hpl.hp.com>

    license: gc/README
    install: -- edit Makefile
		    set CC=gcc
		    value of CFLAGS : remove -DALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS
				      add -DLARGE_CONFIG
	     -- make
	     -- cp gc.a /usr/lib/libgc.a
	     -- cp include/gc.h include/gc_cpp.h /usr/include

    library: gdbm
    release: gdbm-1.8.0
     author: phil@cs.wwu.edu
  home page: 
    bugs to: downsj@downsj.com
     get at: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdbm/
    license: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      notes: Makefile.in has "prefix = /usr/local", so when installing, you must
		use "make prefix=/whatever" to install in a nonstandard place.
	        Also, if you aren't root, it will try to change the ownership of
		the installed files, so change BINOWN and BINGRP to suit you.

    library: gmp
    release: gmp-4.1
     author: Torbjorn Granlund <tege@nada.kth.se>
  home page: 
    bugs to: <bug-gmp@prep.ai.mit.edu>
     get at: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gmp
    license: gmp/COPYING.LIB
      notes: on Solaris, gmp will use both cc and gcc; don't worry
	     Also, make sure you patch the source with the diffs in INSTALL.gmp-4.1-patch
		or else it gets confused when including modern versions of gmp.h.
	 	Do it this way:
			patch -p1 < ...../INSTALL.gmp-4.1-patch

    library: Singular-factory (libcf libcfmem)
    release: factory-2.0.4b
     author: G-M. Greuel <greuel@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

     get at: ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/
    license: GPL
      notes: ./configure --disable-streamio --with-memman=no --enable-NTL
	     make
	     make install
		-- don't bother with 'make gftables'

    library: Singular-libfac
    release: libfac-2.0.4b
     author: Michael Messollen <mmessollen@web.de>
  home page: http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/
     get at: ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/SOURCES/
    license: GPL
      notes: ./configure --with-NOSTREAMIO
	     make DEFS=-DHAVE_SINGULAR_ERROR
	     make install

	     Sometimes the configure script doesn't work.  For example, if
		factory.h has been installed under $prefix/include, it won't find it.
		And it can erroneously decide that 'const' and 'inline' keywords don't
		work, and add -Dconst= -Dinline= to DEFS.  This results in a stream of
		error messages about duplicate declarations.
	     Also, ignore the warning message about factory.h being missing, if you think you've put
		it in $prefix/include.

    library: NTL
    release: 5.2
     author: Victor Shoup
  home page: http://www.shoup.net/
     get at: ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/src/Singular-NTL-5.2.tar.gz
    license: GPL
      notes: The version available through Singular, mentioned above, has had unneeded routines that
	     use iostreams stripped out.

-----------------------
Compiling
-----------------------

Quick and easy:

	./configure
	make
	make check
	make install

To compile in another directory, for example, in a subdirectory:

	mkdir COMPILE
	cd COMPILE
	../configure
	make
	make check
	make install

To make a distribution tarball:

	../configure --enable-encap --with-encapdir=/tmp
	make
	make check
	make install
	make distribution

To use a different prefix, say /mnt/local, for finding libraries and include
files installed in a nonstandard location:

	LDFLAGS=-L/mnt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/mnt/local/include ../configure ...

where ... represents the remaining arguments, as above.

-----------------------
Windows 95, 98 and NT notes
-----------------------

There are two ways to compile Macaulay 2 under Windows 95 and NT.

	-------------------------------
	Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler
	-------------------------------

	We use Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler version 5.0 with service pack
	2.  First install the "gnuish" utilities in C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32:
	awk.exe, cp.exe, gawk.exe, grep.exe, ls.exe, make.exe, mv.exe,
	pwd.exe, rm.exe, sed.exe, and uname.exe.  Then open up the workspace,
	M2.dsw, set it to build the Release version, and start it compiling.

	To set the PATH environment variable used by the Developer Studio
	for custom build steps, edit the registry entry:
		My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio
			\5.0\Build System\Components\Platforms\Win32 (x86)
			\Directories\Path Dirs

	----------------------
	The Cygnus port of GCC
	----------------------

	Download cdk.exe from http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/ and
	type make.  It should all work!  (oops, does this require
	distribution of a .dll file, too?)

	You will also want to pick up emacs for Windows from
	http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html .

	Configure with the option
		--without-dumpdata

	Problems:
	   general:
		environment variables are all upper case!
		read() isn't interruptable
	   make:
		'export' does not work in makefiles.
		some targets in makefiles get run in parallel (?)
	   c library:
		abort() seems to be equivalent to exit(0)
	   bash:
		'cd ..' doesn't work from the initial directory
		when bash is started by emacs
	   ps:
		reports WIN32-PID in octal instead of decimal
	   kill:
		doesn't ever kill any processes

MacOS X notes
----------------------
The easiest way to install Macaulay2 under Mac OS X is to use the Fink system
<http://fink.sourceforge.net>.  Follow the instructions at the Fink website
to install Fink itself, add unstable/main to the appropriate line in
/sw/etc/fink.conf, and then install Fink's "macaulay2" package.  You can
choose the binary installation method or the source installation method
(which will download the source files and compile them on your machine).  You
may also wish to install emacs or xemacs using Fink, for the best interface
to Macaulay2.

Fink can also be used to install other software of interest to
mathematicians.  In most cases, you simply install the relevant Fink package.
In two special cases -- the X11 windowing system, and TeX -- it is possible
to install the software using another method, and then tell Fink about it (by
installing Fink's packages "system-xfree86" and "system-tetex",
respectively).

Note, June 1, 2003: The bug, which caused Macaulay2 for Mac OS X as compiled
by fink as version 0.9.2-6 to crash occasionally, has been fixed!  The
problem was that the garbage collector library, gc, was configured
incorrectly.  It passes all the tests, so look forward to a version that fink
will call "stable".

Issues remaining:
  the fink ".info" file needs to be improved
  post install:
      the M2, M2-help, and emacs/M2-init.el files need to be patched

Each user needs to do the following after installation:
  add to .emacs file
    (load "/sw/lib/Macaulay2-0.9.2/emacs/M2-init.el")

These are done by the fink macaulay2 package, but if you compile on your own,
you may need to do the following:

        ar x /sw/lib/libfac.a tmpl_inst.o
        mv tmpl_inst.o libfac_tmpl_inst.o

Dumpdata doesn't work, I haven't tried removing --disable-strip yet.
Here is the configure line I have used that works:

./configure --disable-strip --disable-dumpdata -prefix=/sw

----------------------
HPUX notes
----------------------

On hppa-2.0w systems, gmp will not compile with gcc, so the configure script
for gmp prefers to use /usr/ccs/bin/cc.  So it is best to install gmp
separately, making sure /usr/ccs/bin is before /usr/local/bin on the path
(just in case gnu nm is in /usr/local/bin).  To use the previously installed
version of gmp when compiling M2, specify the option --with-gmp to configure,
or in configure.options.

Why don't we simply unset CC when automatically configuring gmp?  Because
under other operating systems, it is desirable for the same compiler to be
used for the whole package.  For example, under Windows, gcc and cl aren't
library compatible.

Another strange problem: the . command in /bin/sh seems to look along the
path instead in the current directory to find the file.  This causes a
problem for 'configure'.  Just edit its first line to use 'bash' instead.

----------------------
Solaris notes
----------------------

Configure with the option
	--without-dumpdata

----------------------
FreeBSD notes
----------------------

The gmp package didn't compile, but luckily I was able to use
the installed libgmp.a instead.  I did this:

	cd lib
	ln -s /usr/lib/libgmp.a libgmp.a

and commented out the Makefile line

	all:: GMP

Dumpdata doesn't work, so configure with the option --disable-dumpdata.

----------------------
DEC Alpha notes
----------------------

Use gcc 3.0 for best results.  If the compiler crashes on one of the files in
Macaulay2/e, compile that one file without --fexpensive-optimizations -O3 .
