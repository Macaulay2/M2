In this directory are the various git submodules corresponding to the git
repositories of the various third party libraries we link with and of the third
party programs we include.  We hope to convert all of the entries in
../libraries to submodules eventually, maintaining our own git repositories for
those libraries and programs, if necessary.

Not all of these submodules get initialized when building Macaulay2, because
some of them may be present already in the OS and detected by ../configure, but
if you wish to have a complete source tree that needs no network access or
downloading during configuration and compilation, then just add "--recursive" to
the "git clone" command line in ../INSTALL.

For instructions about adding a new submodule, follow the same instructions as
presented in the file ../libraries/README.
