Libraries
---------

Here are the libraries you have to download and install on your system before
you can compile and link Macaulay 2.  We always compile with gcc.

    library: Singular-factory
    release: factory-1.3b, tar file date 2001/06/25
     author: G-M. Greuel <greuel@mathematik.uni-kl.de>
	     R. Stobbe <stobbe@mathematik.uni-kl.de>
	     J. Schmidt
	     G. Pfister <pfister@mathematik.uni-kl.de>
	     H. Schoenemann <hannes@mathematik.uni-kl.de>
     get at: /ftp@www.mathematik.uni-kl.de:/pub/Math/Singular/Factory
    license: GPL
      notes: ./configure --disable-streamio

    library: Singular-libfac
    release: libfac-0.3.2, tar file date 2001/06/28
	     (that version number is in 00README; in configure.in it says 0.3.0)
     author: Michael Messollen <mmessollen@web.de>
     get at: /ftp@www.mathematik.uni-kl.de:/pub/Math/Singular/Libfac
    license: GPL
      notes: Sometimes the configure script doesn't work.  For example, if
		factory.h has been installed under $prefix/include, it won't find it.
		And it can erroneously decide that 'const' and 'inline' keywords don't
		work, and add -Dconst= -Dinline= to DEFS.
	     Also, make sure you patch the source with the diffs in README.libfac-0.3.2,
		or else it gets confused about the NOSTREAMIO option.
	     Also, ignore the warning message about factory.h being missin, if you think you've put
		it in $prefix/include.

    library: gmp
    release: gmp-3.1.1
     author: Torbjorn Granlund <tege@nada.kth.se>
    bugs to: <bug-gmp@prep.ai.mit.edu>
     get at: /ftp@ftp.gnu.org:gnu/gmp
    license: gmp/COPYING.LIB
      notes: on Solaris, gmp will use both cc and gcc; don't worry

    library: gc
    release: 6.0 (see file gc/version.h)
     author: Hans Boehm <hboehm@exch.hpl.hp.com>
     get at: http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/gc6.0.tar.gz
    license: gc/README
    install: -- edit Makefile
		    set CC=gcc
		    value of CFLAGS : remove -DALL_INTERIOR_POINTERS
				      add    -DLARGE_CONFIG -DNO_DEBUGGING
	     -- make
	     -- cp gc.a /usr/lib/libgc.a
	     -- cp include/gc.h and include/gc_cpp.h /usr/include

-----------------------
Compiling
-----------------------

To compile Macaulay 2 type 'make' in this directory.  The resulting shell
script, ./Macaulay2/bin/M2, can then be installed in /usr/local/bin.  The
resulting files distributions/Macaulay2-*-tar.gz file can be distributed.

-----------------------
Windows 95, 98 and NT notes
-----------------------

There are two ways to compile Macaulay 2 under Windows 95 and NT.

	-------------------------------
	Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler
	-------------------------------

	We use Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler version 5.0 with service pack
	2.  First install the "gnuish" utilities in C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32:
	awk.exe, cp.exe, gawk.exe, grep.exe, ls.exe, make.exe, mv.exe,
	pwd.exe, rm.exe, sed.exe, and uname.exe.  Then open up the workspace,
	M2.dsw, set it to build the Release version, and start it compiling.

	To set the PATH environment variable used by the Developer Studio
	for custom build steps, edit the registry entry:
		My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio
			\5.0\Build System\Components\Platforms\Win32 (x86)
			\Directories\Path Dirs

	----------------------
	The Cygnus port of GCC
	----------------------

	Download cdk.exe from http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/ and
	type make.  It should all work!  (oops, does this require
	distribution of a .dll file, too?)

	You will also want to pick up emacs for Windows from
	http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html .

	Configure with the option
		--without-dumpdata

	Problems:
	   general:
		environment variables are all upper case!
		read() isn't interruptable
	   make:
		'export' does not work in makefiles.
		some targets in makefiles get run in parallel (?)
	   c library:
		abort() seems to be equivalent to exit(0)
	   bash:
		'cd ..' doesn't work from the initial directory
		when bash is started by emacs
	   ps:
		reports WIN32-PID in octal instead of decimal
	   kill:
		doesn't ever kill any processes

Linux notes

HPUX notes
----------------------

On hppa-2.0w systems, gmp will not compile with gcc, so the configure script
for gmp prefers to use /usr/ccs/bin/cc.  So it is best to install gmp
separately, making sure /usr/ccs/bin is before /usr/local/bin on the path
(just in case gnu nm is in /usr/local/bin).  To use the previously installed
version of gmp when compiling M2, specify the option --with-gmp to configure,
or in Makefile.overrides.

Why don't we simply unset CC when automatically configuring gmp?  Because
under other operating systems, it is desirable for the same compiler to be
used for the whole package.  For example, under Windows, gcc and cl aren't
library compatible.

Another strange problem: the . command in /bin/sh seems to look along the
path instead in the current directory to find the file.  This causes a
problem for 'configure'.  Just edit its first line to use 'bash' instead.

----------------------
Solaris notes
----------------------

Configure with the option
	--without-dumpdata

----------------------
FreeBSD notes
----------------------

The gmp package didn't compile, but luckily I was able to use
the installed libgmp.a instead.  I did this:

	cd lib
	ln -s /usr/lib/libgmp.a libgmp.a

and commented out the Makefile line

	all:: GMP

Dumpdata doesn't work, so configure with the option --disable-dumpdata.
