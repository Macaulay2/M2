In this directory we have two files that can be used to redirect inclusions of
GMP files to MPIR files.  Flint, in particular, doesn't seem to have a
convenient configure option for specifying whether to use MPIR instead of GMP
-- it just includes gmp.h.

The way we bring these two files into play for flint is by compiling with a -I
option pointing to this directory.
