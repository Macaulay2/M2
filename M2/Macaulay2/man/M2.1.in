The documentation for \fIMacaulay2\fP is available locally starting in
@docdir@/Macaulay2Doc/html/index.html, where ${prefix} is replaced by the directory prefix used when
the package was installed.  The directory is available as the value of the \fIMacaulay2\fP variable
prefixDirectory, but the best way to get to the documentation is to run the command \fIviewHelp\fP in \fIMacaulay2\fP.

The home page for \fIMacaulay2\fP is \fBhttp://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/\fR.
