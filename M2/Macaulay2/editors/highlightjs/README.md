Macaulay2 in highlight.js
=========================

[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) is a JavaScript syntax highlighter
with language auto-detection and zero dependencies.  It is used by the popular
presentation framework [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).  It was also used
for syntax highlighting examples in the Macaulay2 html documentation in
versions 1.20 and 1.21, but has since been replaced with
[Prism](https://prismjs.com/).
