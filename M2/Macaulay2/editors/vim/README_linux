These are files useful for running M2 inside vim on a GNU/Linux machine. 
These use the scripts by David Cook II (earlier available at
http://www.ms.uky.edu/~dcook/files/Macaulay2.vim).

I. Required programmes

    1. xterm 
    2. screen
    3. vim

II. Files included 

    0. 0README_linux  (this file)
    
    1. m2.vimrc (the RC file that sets the file-type, loads the dictionary
file and the syntax file, etc.) 

    2. m2.vim.dict (vim dictionary file, used for completion and
spell-check)

    3. m2.vim.syntax (instructions on how the various types of words are to
be highlighted)

    4. m2.vim.plugin (the main file that implements how M2 commands from
the vim window is transferred to M2 running inside a screen session)

    5. VimM2.scpt (wrapper Apple script around Terminal.app to start the M2
session inside a screen session)

III. Usage

    1. copy m2.vimrc as $HOME/.vim/m2.vimrc, and source it from $HOME/.vimrc, preferably with

    au BufRead, BufNewFile *.m2 so $HOME/.vim/m2.vimrc

    2. copy m2.vim.dict as $HOME/.vim/dict/m2.vim.dict 

    3. copy m2.vim.syntax as $HOME/.vim/syntax/m2.vim, without the .syntax
at the end. (vim did not recognize the file with the .syntax at the end;
perhaps some option may be set to take care of this issue.)

    4. copy m2.vim.plugin as $HOME/.vim/plugin/m2.vim  and as 
$HOME/.vim/ftplugin/m2.vim, without the .plugin at the end. (vim did not
recognize the file with the .plugin at the end; perhaps some option may be
set to take care of this issue. Further, depending on whether the filetype
detection and plugin options are ON, the file inside the ftplugin
directory might not be read.)
