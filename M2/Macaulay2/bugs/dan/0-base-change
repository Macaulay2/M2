Perhaps the tensor product way with a module should work.  Probably my thinking
was that R1 is not a precursor of R1, so there might be various ring maps one
    	       	     	       	  ^^
				  R2
could intend.

Meanwhile, try this:

    i10 : map(R2,R1) ** M

    o10 = cokernel | x2 |

				   1
    o10 : R2-module, quotient of R2

Applying a ring map to a module with relations runs against the grain of
standard mathematical notation, though, so I think I will leave that.

Perhaps it will be enough to add more info to this error message:

    i9 : substitute(M, R2) -- produces an error suggesting the next line
    stdio:9:1:(1):[0]: ring map applied to module with relations: use '**' or 'tensor' instead
