things to do manually before release

       look at html documentation 

       look at info documentation

       try viewHelp

       update Macaulay2/man/M2.1.in

       check that getPackage works for all the packages available

       test *.rpm files

       test *.deb files

       test *.tar.gz file

       check that alarm works or devise an automated test

       check that installPackage works for the user (now, with no symbolic links)
       	     and that it creates a documentation database and finds and uses it
