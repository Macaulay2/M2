I think I'll try to fix the M2 code so instead of checking whether MACAULAY2 is
set, it checks whether PATH contains the desired directory.  Same for INFOPATH, etc.

=============================================================================

*** Nevertheless, I should also have the setup() function do one more thing: if
/foo/bar/Macaulay2-@VERSION@/info/dir is writable or doesn't exist and its
directory is writable, then it should put entries in that file for each of the
info files accompanying Macaulay 2, to make that documentation visible to the
user. ***

--- and maybe that should also be done each time by installPackage and uninstallPackage.!
