-- Jan 27 2011: hyperplane arrangements package;
-- Graham Denham and Greg Smith, with
-- thanks to Sorin Popescu for the Orlik-Solomon code
--
-- release 0.8:
-- * previously, all arrangements were assumed to be central:
--   some code also worked for affine arrangements, and some
--   broke.  Now we allow affine arrangements where possible,
--   by making central arrangements a new type.
-- * removed some undocumented functions.
--
-- release 0.8-: 
-- corrects a bug that affected multiplier ideals, added log-canonical
-- threshold
--
-- release 0.7:
-- more canned arrangements
-- 
-- new in release 0.6: multiplier ideals; bug fixes (in particular
-- involving empty arrangements); some caching; a "circuits" method;
-- test for (Lie algebra) decomposability; a random arrangement;
-- a hash table full of popular "canned" arrangements.
-- 
-- 6 Jan 09: fixed bug in changeRing and errors in TEST section
-- 1 Jun 09: fixed inconsistency in multIdeal

     "A hyperplane arrangement is a finite set of hyperplanes in an
     affine or projective space.  In this package, an arrangement is 
     expressed as a list of (linear) defining equations for the hyperplanes.
     The tools provided allow the user to create new arrangements from
     old, and to compute various algebraic invariants of arrangements."
