    	finite group characters on free resolutions and graded modules
    Description
    	Text
	    This package contains functions for computing characters
	    of free resolutions and graded modules equipped with
	    the action of a finite group.
	    
	    Let $R$ be a positively graded polynomial ring over a
	    field $\Bbbk$, and $M$ a finitely generated graded
	    $R$-module. Suppose $G$ is a finite group whose order
	    is not divisible by the characteristic of $\Bbbk$.
	    Assume $G$ acts $\Bbbk$-linearly on $R$ and $M$
	    by preserving degrees, and distributing over
	    $R$-multiplication.
	    If $F_\bullet$ is a minimal free resolution of $M$, and
	    $\mathfrak{m}$ denotes the maximal ideal generated by the variables
	    of $R$, then each $F_i / \mathfrak{m}F_i$ is a graded
	    $G$-representation. We call the
	    characters of the representations $F_i / \mathfrak{m}F_i$
	    the {\bf Betti characters} of $M$, since
	    evaluating them at the identity element of $G$ returns
	    the usual Betti numbers of $M$.
	    Moreover, the graded
	    components of $M$ are also $G$-representations.
	    
	    This package provides functions to
	    compute the Betti characters and the characters of
	    graded components of $M$
	    based on the algorithms in @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2022.02.001","F. Galetto - Finite group characters on free resolutions")@.
	    The package is designed to
	    be independent of the group; the user provides matrices for
	    the group actions and character tables (to decompose
		characters into irreducibles).
	    See the menu below for using this package
	    to compute some examples from the literature.

       Specht ideals / subspace arrangements
   Description
    Text
    	In this example, we identify the Betti characters of the
	Specht ideal associated	with the partition (5,2).
	The action of the symmetric group on the resolution of
	this ideal is described in	
	@arXiv("2010.06522",
	    "K. Shibata, K. Yanagawa - Minimal free resolutions of the Specht ideals of shapes (n−2,2) and (d,d,1)")@.
	The same ideal is also the ideal of the 6-equals
	subspace arrangement in a 7-dimensional affine space.
	This point of view is explored in
	@HREF("https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-014-2010-4",
	    "C. Berkesch, S. Griffeth, S. Sam - Jack polynomials as fractional quantum Hall states and the Betti numbers of the (k+1)-equals ideal")@
	where the action of the symmetric group on the resolution
	is also described.
	
	We begin by constructing the ideal explicitly.
	As an alternative, the ideal can be obtained using the
	function @TT "spechtPolynomials"@
	provided by the package @TT "SpechtModule"@.
	We compute a minimal free resolution and its Betti table.
    Example
    	R=QQ[x_1..x_7]
	I1=ideal apply({4,5,6,7}, i -> (x_1-x_2)*(x_3-x_i));
	I2=ideal apply(subsets({3,4,5,6,7},2), s -> (x_1-x_(s#0))*(x_2-x_(s#1)));
	I=I1+I2
	RI=res I
	betti RI
    Text
    	Next we set up the group action on the resolution.
	The group is the symmetric group on 7 elements.
	Its conjugacy classes are determined by cycle types,
	which are in bijection with partitions of 7.
	Representatives for the conjugacy classes of the symmetric
	group acting on a polynomial ring by permuting the
	variables can be obtained via @TO symmetricGroupActors@.
	Once the action is set up, we compute the Betti characters.
    Example
    	S7 = symmetricGroupActors R
	A = action(RI,S7)
	elapsedTime c = character A
    Text
    	To make sense of these characters we decompose them
	against	the character table of the symmetric group,
	which can be computed using the function
	@TO "symmetricGroupTable"@. The irreducible characters
	are indexed by the partitions of 7, which are written
	using a compact notation (the exponents indicate how
	    many times a part is repeated).
    Example
    	T = symmetricGroupTable R
	decomposeCharacter(c,T)
    Text
    	As expected from the general theory, we find a single
	irreducible representation in each homological degree.
	
	Finally, we can observe the Gorenstein duality of the
	resolution and its character. We construct the character
	of the sign representation concentrated in homological
	degree 0, internal degree 7. Then we dualize the character
	of the resolution previously computed, shift its homological
	degree by the length of the resolution, and twist it by
	the sign character just constructed: the result is the
	same as the character of the resolution.
    Example
    	sign = character(R,15,hashTable {(0,{7}) =>
		matrix{{1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1}}})
	dual(c,id_QQ)[-5] ** sign === c
    Text
    	The second argument in the @TT "dual"@ command is the
	restriction of complex conjugation to the field of
	definition of the characters.
	For more information, see @TO (dual,Character,RingMap)@.

       Symbolic powers of star configurations
   Description
    Text
    	In this example, we identify the Betti characters of the
	third symbolic power of a monomial star configuration.
	The action of the symmetric group on the resolution of
	this ideal is described in Example 6.5 of
	@HREF("https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2020.04.037",
	    "J. Biermann, H. De Alba, F. Galetto, S. Murai, U. Nagel, A. O'Keefe, T. Römer, A. Seceleanu - Betti numbers of symmetric shifted ideals")@,
	and belongs to the larger class of symmetric shifted
	ideals.
	
	First, we construct the ideal
	and compute its minimal free resolution and Betti table.
    Example
	R=QQ[x_1..x_6]
	I=intersect(apply(subsets(gens R,4),x->(ideal x)^3))
	RI=res I
	betti RI
    Text
    	Next, we set up the group action on the resolution.
	The group is the symmetric group on 6 elements.
	Its conjugacy classes are determined by cycle types,
	which are in bijection with partitions of 6.
	Representatives for the conjugacy classes of the symmetric
	group acting on a polynomial ring by permuting the
	variables can be obtained via @TO symmetricGroupActors@.
	After setting up the action, we compute the Betti characters.
    Example
    	S6 = symmetricGroupActors R
	A=action(RI,S6)
	elapsedTime c=character A
    Text
    	Next, we decompose the characters
	against	the character table of the symmetric group,
	which can be computed using the function
	@TO "symmetricGroupTable"@. The irreducible characters
	are indexed by the partitions of 6, which are written
	using a compact notation (the exponents indicate how
	    many times a part is repeated).
    Example
    	T = symmetricGroupTable R
	decomposeCharacter(c,T)
    Text
    	The description provided in
	@HREF("https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgebra.2020.04.037",
	    "J. Biermann, H. De Alba, F. Galetto, S. Murai, U. Nagel, A. O'Keefe, T. Römer, A. Seceleanu - Betti numbers of symmetric shifted ideals")@
	uses representations induced from products of smaller
	symmetric groups. To compare that description with the results
	obtained here, one may use the Littlewood-Richardson rule
	to decompose induced representations into a direct sum
	of irreducibles.

       Klein configuration of points
   Description
    Text
    	In this example, we identify the Betti characters of the
	defining ideal of the Klein configuration of points in the
	projective plane and its square.
	The defining ideal of the Klein configuration is
	explicitly constructed in Proposition 7.3 of
	@HREF("https://doi.org/10.1093/imrn/rnx329",
	    "T. Bauer, S. Di Rocco, B. Harbourne, J. Huizenga, A. Seceleanu, T. Szemberg - Negative Curves on Symmetric Blowups of the Projective Plane, Resurgences, and Waldschmidt Constants")@.
	We start by constructing the ideal, its square, and both
	their resolutions and Betti tables. In order to later use
	characters, we work over the cyclotomic field obtained by
	adjoining a primitive 7th root of unity to $\mathbb{Q}$.
    Example
    	needsPackage "Cyclotomic"
	kk = toField(QQ[a] / cyclotomicPoly(7, a))
	R = kk[x,y,z]
	f4 = x^3*y+y^3*z+z^3*x
	H = jacobian transpose jacobian f4
	f6 = -1/54*det(H)
	I = minors(2,jacobian matrix{{f4,f6}})
	RI = res I

	I2 = I^2;
	RI2 = res I2

	The unique simple group of order 168 acts as described
	in §2.2 of @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1093/imrn/rnx329",
	"BDHHSS")@. In particular, the group is generated by the
	elements @TT "g"@ of order 7, @TT "h"@ of order 3, and
	@TT "i"@ of order 2, and is minimally defined over the
	7th cyclotomic field. In addition, we consider the identity,
	the inverse of @TT "g"@,
	and another element @TT "j"@ of order 4 as representatives
	of the conjugacy classes of the group.
	The action of the group on the resolution of
	both ideals is described in the second proof of
	Proposition 8.1.
    Example
	g = matrix{{a^4,0,0},{0,a^2,0},{0,0,a}}
	h = matrix{{0,1,0},{0,0,1},{1,0,0}}
	i = (2*a^4+2*a^2+2*a+1)/7 * matrix{
    	    {a-a^6,a^2-a^5,a^4-a^3},
    	    {a^2-a^5,a^4-a^3,a-a^6},
    	    {a^4-a^3,a-a^6,a^2-a^5}
    	    }
	j = -1/(2*a^4+2*a^2+2*a+1) * matrix{
    	    {a^5-a^4,1-a^5,1-a^3},
    	    {1-a^5,a^6-a^2,1-a^6},
    	    {1-a^3,1-a^6,a^3-a}
    	    }
	G = {id_(R^3),i,h,j,g,inverse g};
    Text
    	We compute the action of this group
	on the two resolutions above.
	Notice how the group action is passed as a list of square
	matrices (instead of one-row substitution matrices as in
	    @TO "BettiCharacters Example 1"@ and
	    @TO "BettiCharacters Example 2"@); to enable this,
	we set the option @TO Sub@ to @TT "false"@.
    Example
	A1 = action(RI,G,Sub=>false)
	A2 = action(RI2,G,Sub=>false)
	elapsedTime a1 = character A1
	elapsedTime a2 = character A2

	The arguments are: a list with the cardinality of the

	characters, the base polynomial ring, and the complex
	conjugation map restricted to the field of coefficients.

    	Since @TT "X0"@ is the trivial character,
	this computation shows that the
	free module in homological degree two in the resolution of the
	defining ideal of the Klein configuration is a direct sum
	of two trivial representations, one in degree 11 and one in
	degree 13. It follows that its second
	exterior power is a trivial representation concentrated in
	degree 24. As observed in the second
	proof of Proposition 8.1 in @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1093/imrn/rnx329",
	"BDHHSS")@, the free module in homological degree 3 in the
    	resolution of the square of the ideal is exactly this
	second exterior power (and a trivial representation).
	
	Alternatively, we can compute the symbolic square of the
	ideal modulo the ordinary square. The component of degree
	21 of this quotient matches the generators of the last
	module in the resolution of the ordinary square in degree
	24 (by local duality); in
	particular, it is a trivial representation. We can verify
	this directly.

	Is2 = symbolicPower(I,2);
	M = Is2 / I2;
	B = action(M,G,Sub=>false)

	    second permuting the $y_j$ variables. We compute the

	    Use this function to define the action of a finite group
	    on the minimal free resolution of a module over a
	    polynomial ring with coefficients in a field.
	    After setting up the action, use the function
	    @TO character@ to compute the Betti characters.
	    
	    The input @TT "G"@ is a @TO List@ of group elements
	    acting on the vector space spanned by the variables
	    of the ring @TT "R"@. By default, these elements are
	    passed as one-row substitution matrices as those
	    accepted by @TO substitute@. One may pass these elements
	    as square matrices by setting the optional input @TO Sub@
	    to @TT "false"@. The list @TT "G"@ can contain
	    arbitrary group elements however, to
	    obtain a complete representation theoretic description
	    of the characters, @TT "G"@ should be a list of
	    representatives of the conjugacy classes of the group.
	    
	    The example below sets up the action of a symmetric
	    group on the resolution of a monomial ideal.
	    The symmetric group acts by permuting the four
	    variables of the ring. The conjugacy classes of
	    permutations are determined by their cycle types,
	    which are in bijection with partitions. In this case,
	    we consider five permutations with cycle types,
	    in order: 4, 31, 22, 211, 1111.
    	Example
	    R = QQ[x_1..x_4]
	    I = ideal apply(subsets(gens R,2),product)
	    RI = res I
	    G = {matrix{{x_2,x_3,x_4,x_1}},
    		 matrix{{x_2,x_3,x_1,x_4}},

	Text
	    The group elements acting on the ring can be recovered
	    using @TO ringActors@, while their inverses can be
	    recovered using @TO inverseRingActors@.
	    To recover just the number of group elements,
	    use @TO numActors@.
	Example
	    ringActors A
	    inverseRingActors A
	    numActors A
	Text
	    The simplified version of this function suffices when
	    dealing with resolutions of quotients of the ring
	    @TT "R"@ by an ideal as in the previous example.
	    In this case, the first module in the resolution is
	    @TT "R"@ and it is assumed that the group acts
	    trivially on the generator of this first module.
	    
	    When resolving modules or when more flexibility is 
	    needed, one may use the general version of the function.
	    In this case, it is necessary to specify a homological
	    degree @TT "i"@ and a list of group elements acting on
	    the module @TT "C_i"@. The group elements are passed
	    as a @TO List@ @TT "G'"@ of matrices written with
	    respect to the basis of @TT "C_i"@ used by Macaulay2.
	    Moreover, the group elements in @TT "G'"@ must match
	    (in number and order) the elements in @TT "G"@.
	    
	    To illustrate, we set up the action on the resolution
	    of the ideal in the previous example considered as a
	    module (as opposed to the resolution of the quotient
	    by the ideal). In this case, the elements of @TT "G'"@
	    are the permutation matrices obtained by acting with
	    elements of @TT "G"@ on the span of the minimal
	    generators of the ideal. For simplicity, we construct
	    these matrices by permuting columns of the identity.
    	Example
	    M = module I
	    RM = res M
	    G' = { (id_(R^6))_{2,4,5,0,1,3},
    		   (id_(R^6))_{2,0,1,4,5,3},
    		   (id_(R^6))_{0,4,3,2,1,5},
    		   (id_(R^6))_{0,2,1,4,3,5},
    		    id_(R^6) }
	    action(RM,G,G',0)
	Text
	    By changing the last argument, it is possible to
	    specify the action of the group on any module of the
	    resolution. For example, suppose we wish to construct
	    the action of the symmetric group on the resolution
	    of the canonical module of the quotient in the first
	    example. In this case, it will be more convenient to
	    declare a trivial action on the last module of the
	    resolution rather than figuring out the action on the
	    first module (i.e., the generators of the canonical
	    module). This can be achieved as follows.
    	Example
	    E = Ext^3(R^1/I,R^{-4})
	    RE = res E
	    G'' = toList(5:id_(R^1))
	    action(RE,G,G'',3)
    Caveat
    	This function does not check if the complex @TT "C"@ is a
	free resolution. If the user passes a complex that is not a
	free resolution, then later computations (i.e., Betti characters)
	may fail or return meaningless results.

    	    This function returns matrices describing elements of a

	    in @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2022.02.001","F. Galetto - Finite group characters on free resolutions")@.

	    To illustrate, we compute the action of a
	    symmetric group on the resolution of a monomial ideal.
	    The ideal is generated by
	    all squarefree monomials of degree two in four variables.
	    The symmetric group acts by permuting the four
	    variables of the ring. We only consider five
	    permutations with cycle types,
	    in order: 4, 31, 22, 211, 1111 (since these are enough
		to determine the characters of the action).

    	this function returns matrices that induce the action of
	group elements on the representations $F_i/\mathfrak{m}F_i$, where
	$\mathfrak{m}$ is the maximal ideal generated by the variables of the
	polynomial ring.
	While these matrices often represent the action of the
	same group elements on the modules $F_i$ of the resolution,
	this is in general not a guarantee.

    	    This function returns matrices describing elements of a

	    (multi)degree @TT "d"@ of a module.

	    To illustrate, we compute the action of a
	    symmetric group on the components of a monomial ideal.
	    The symmetric group acts by permuting the four
	    variables of the ring. We only consider five
	    permutations with cycle types,
	    in order: 4, 31, 22, 211, 1111 (since these are enough
		to determine the characters of the action).

    Description
    	Text
	    Use this function to compute the Betti characters of a
	    finite group action on a minimal free resolution
	    in a given homological degree.
	    More explicitly, let $F_\bullet$ be a minimal free
	    resolution of a module $M$ over a polynomial ring $R$,
	    with a compatible action of a finite group $G$.
	    If $\mathfrak{m}$ denotes the maximal ideal generated by the
	    variables of $R$, then $F_i/\mathfrak{m}F_i$ is a graded
	    representation of $G$. We refer to its character as
	    the $i$-th {\bf Betti character} of $M$ (or a minimal free
	    resolution of $M$).
	    Betti characters are computed using Algorithm 1 in
	    @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2022.02.001","F. Galetto - Finite group characters on free resolutions")@.

	    To illustrate, we compute the Betti characters of a
	    symmetric group on the resolution of a monomial ideal.
	    The ideal is the symbolic square of the ideal generated by
	    all squarefree monomials of degree three in four variables.
	    The symmetric group acts by permuting the four
	    variables of the ring. The characters are determined
	    by five permutations with cycle types,
	    in order: 4, 31, 22, 211, 1111.

	    RJ = res J

	    character(A,0)
	Text
	    By construction, the character in homological degree
	    0 is concentrated in degree 0 and trivial.
	Example
	    character(A,1)
	Text
	    The character in homological degree 1 has two
	    components. The component of degree 3 is the permutation
	    representation spanned by the squarefree monomials of
	    degree 3 (which can be identified with the natural
		representation of the symmetric group).
	    The component of degree 4 is the permutation representation
	    spanned by the squares of the squarefree monomials of degree
	    2.
	Example
	    character(A,2)
	Text
	    In homological degree 2, there is a component of degree
	    4 which is isomorphic to the irreducible standard
	    representation of the symmetric group.
	    In degree 5, we find the permutation representation of
	    the symmetric group on the set of ordered pairs of
	    distinct elements from 1 to 4.
	Example
	    character(A,3)
	Text
	    Finally, the character in homological degree 3 is
	    concentrated in degree 6 and corresponds to the direct
	    sum of the standard representation and the tensor
	    product of the standard representation and the sign
	    representation (i.e., the direct sum of the two
		irreducible representations of dimension 3).

	    The @TO character@ method is mainly designed to compute

	    The user who wishes to define characters by hand
	    may do so with this particular application of the method.
	    
	    The first argument is the polynomial ring the character
	    values will live in; this makes it possible to compare or
	    combine the hand-constructed character with other
	    characters over the same ring. The second argument is
	    the length of the character, i.e., the number of conjugacy
	    classes of the group whose representations the character
	    is coming from. The third argument is a hash table
	    containing the "raw" character data. The hash table
	    entries are in the format @TT "(i,d) => c"@, where @TT "i"@
	    is an integer representing homological degree, @TT "d"@
	    is a list representing the internal (multi)degree, and
	    @TT "c"@ is a list containing the values of the character
	    in the given degrees. Note that the values of the character
	    are elements in the ring given as the first argument.
	Example
	    R = QQ[x_1..x_3]
	    regRep = character(R,3, hashTable {
		    (0,{0}) => matrix{{1,1,1}},
		    (0,{1}) => matrix{{-1,0,2}},
		    (0,{2}) => matrix{{-1,0,2}},
		    (0,{3}) => matrix{{1,-1,1}},
		    })
	    I = ideal(x_1+x_2+x_3,x_1*x_2+x_1*x_3+x_2*x_3,x_1*x_2*x_3)
	    S3 = {matrix{{x_2,x_3,x_1}},
		  matrix{{x_2,x_1,x_3}},
		  matrix{{x_1,x_2,x_3}} }
	    Q = R/I
	    A = action(Q,S3)
	    character(A,0,3) === regRep

    Description
    	Text
	    Use the @TO characterTable@ method to construct
	    the character table of a finite group.
	    
	    The first argument is a list containing the cardinalities
	    of the conjugacy classes of the group.
	    
	    The second argument is a square matrix whose entry in
	    row $i$ and column $j$ is the value of the $i$-th
	    irreducible character of the group at an element
	    of the $j$-th conjugacy class.
	    
	    The third argument is a polynomial ring over a field,
	    the same ring over which the modules and resolutions
	    are defined whose characters are to be decomposed
	    against the character table. Note that the matrix in
	    the second argument must be liftable to this ring.
	    
	    Assuming the polynomial ring in the third argument
	    has a coefficient field @TT "F"@ which is a subfield of the
	    complex numbers, then the fourth argument is the
	    restriction of complex conjugation to @TT "F"@.
	    
	    For example, we construct the character table of the
	    alternating group $A_4$ considered as a subgroup of the
	    symmetric group $S_4$. The conjugacy classes are
	    represented by the identity, and the permutations
	    $(12)(34)$, $(123)$, and $(132)$, in cycle notation.
	    These conjugacy classes have cardinalities: 1, 3, 4, 4.
	    The irreducible characters can be constructed over the
	    field $\mathbb{Q}[w]$, where $w$ is a primitive third
	    root of unity. Complex conjugation restricts to
	    $\mathbb{Q}[w]$ by sending $w$ to $w^2$.
    	Example
	    F = toField(QQ[w]/ideal(1+w+w^2))
	    s = {1,3,4,4}
	    M = matrix{{1,1,1,1},{1,1,w,w^2},{1,1,w^2,w},{3,-1,0,0}}
	    R = F[x_1..x_4]
	    conj = map(F,F,{w^2})
	    T = characterTable(s,M,R,conj)
    	Text	    
	    By default, irreducible characters in a character table
	    are labeled as @TT "X0, X1, ..."@, etc.
	    The user may pass custom labels in a list using
	    the option @TO Labels@.
	    
	    When working over a splitting field for a finite group
	    $G$ in the non modular case, the irreducible characters
	    of $G$ form an orthonormal basis for the space of class
	    functions on $G$ with the scalar product given by
	    $$\langle \chi_1, \chi_2 \rangle = \frac{1}{|G|}
	    \sum_{g\in G} \chi_1 (g) \chi_2 (g^{-1}).$$
    	    Over the complex numbers, the second factor in the summation
	    is equal to $\overline{\chi_2 (g)}$. Thus the scalar
	    product can be computed using the conjugation function
	    provided by the user.
	    
    	    If working over coefficient fields of positive characteristic
	    or if one wishes to avoid defining conjugation, one may replace
	    the fourth argument by a list containing a permutation
	    $\pi$ of the integers $1,\dots,r$, where
	    $r$ is the number of conjugacy classes of the group.
	    The permutation $\pi$ is defined as follows:
	    if $g$ is an element of the $j$-th conjugacy class,
	    then $g^{-1}$ is an element of the $\pi (j)$-th class.
	    
	    In the case of $A_4$, the identity and $(12)(34)$ are
	    their own inverses, while $(123)^{-1} = (132)$.
	    Therefore the permutation $\pi$ is the transposition
	    exchanging 3 and 4. Hence the character table of $A_4$
	    may also be constructed as follows, with $\pi$
	    represented in one-line notation by a list passed
	    as the fourth argument.
    	Example
	    perm = {1,2,4,3}
	    T' = characterTable(s,M,R,perm)
	    T' === T
    Caveat
    	This constructor checks orthonormality of the table
	matrix under the standard scalar product of characters.
	However, it may still be possible to construct a table
	that is not an actual character table. Note also that
	there are no further checks when using a character table
	to decompose characters.

    Usage

    Inputs
    	c:Character

	    conjugation in coefficient field
    	perm:List
	    permutation of conjugacy classes
    Outputs
    	:Character
    Description
    	Text
	    Returns the dual of a character, i.e., the character
	    of the dual or contragredient representation.
	    
	    The first argument is the original character.
	    
	    Assuming the polynomial ring over which the character
	    is defined has a coefficient field @TT "F"@ which is a subfield
	    of the complex numbers, then the second argument is the
	    restriction of complex conjugation to @TT "F"@.
	    
	    As an example, we construct a character of the
	    alternating group $A_4$ considered as a subgroup of the
	    symmetric group $S_4$. The conjugacy classes are
	    represented by the identity, and the permutations
	    $(12)(34)$, $(123)$, and $(132)$, in cycle notation.
	    The character is constructed over the field $\mathbb{Q}[w]$,
	    where $w$ is a primitive third root of unity.
	    Complex conjugation restricts to $\mathbb{Q}[w]$
	    by sending $w$ to $w^2$. The character is concentrated
	    in homological degree 1, and internal degree 2.
	Example
	    F = toField(QQ[w]/ideal(1+w+w^2))
	    R = F[x_1..x_4]
	    conj = map(F,F,{w^2})
	    X = character(R,4,hashTable {(1,{2}) => matrix{{1,1,w,w^2}}})
	    X' = dual(X,conj)
    	Text
    	    If working over coefficient fields of positive characteristic
	    or if one wishes to avoid defining conjugation, one may replace
	    the second argument by a list containing a permutation
	    $\pi$ of the integers $1,\dots,r$, where
	    $r$ is the number of conjugacy classes of the group.
	    The permutation $\pi$ is defined as follows:
	    if $g$ is an element of the $j$-th conjugacy class,
	    then $g^{-1}$ is an element of the $\pi (j)$-th class.
	    
	    In the case of $A_4$, the identity and $(12)(34)$ are
	    their own inverses, while $(123)^{-1} = (132)$.
	    Therefore the permutation $\pi$ is the transposition
	    exchanging 3 and 4. Hence the dual of the character in the
	    example above may also be constructed as follows,
	    with $\pi$ represented in one-line notation by a list passed
	    as the second argument.
    	Example
    	    perm = {1,2,4,3}
	    dual(X,perm) === X'
    	Text
	    The page @TO characterTable@ contains some motivation
	    for using conjugation or permutations of conjugacy
	    classes when dealing with characters.

    Description
    	Text
	    This optional input is used with the method
	    @TO characterTable@  provided by the package
	    @TO BettiCharacters@.
	    
	    By default, irreducible characters in a character table
	    are labeled as @TT "X0, X1, ..."@, etc.
	    The user may pass custom labels in a list using
	    this option.
	    
	    The next example sets up the character table of
	    the dihedral group $D_4$, generated by an order 4 rotation $r$
	    and an order 2 reflection $s$ with the relation $srs=r^3$.
	    The representatives of the conjugacy classes are, in order:
	    the identity, $r^2$, $r$, $s$, and $rs$.
	    Besides the trivial representation, $D_4$ has three irreducible
	    one-dimensional representations, corresponding to the three normal
	    subgroups of index two: $\langle r\rangle$, $\langle r^,,s\rangle$,
	    and $\langle r^2,rs\rangle$. The characters of these representations
	    send the elements of the corresponding subgroup to 1, and the other
	    elements to -1. We denote those characters @TT "rho1,rho2,rho3"@.
	    Finally, there is a unique irreducible representation of dimension 2.
    	Example
	    R = QQ[x,y]
	    D8 = { matrix{{x,y}},
	   	   matrix{{-x,-y}},
	   	   matrix{{-y,x}},
		   matrix{{x,-y}},
		   matrix{{y,x}} }
	    M = matrix {{1,1,1,1,1},
		{1,1,1,-1,-1},
		{1,1,-1,1,-1},

	    T = characterTable({1,1,2,2,2},M,R,{1,2,3,4,5},
		Labels=>{"triv","rho1","rho2","rho3","dim2"})
    	Text
	    The same labels are automatically used when decomposing
	    characters against a labeled character table.
    	Example
	    A = action(R,D8)
	    c = character(A,0,8)
	    decomposeCharacter(c,T)
    	Text
	    The labels are stored in the character table under the

	    By default, the group elements acting on a ring are

	    The example below sets up the action of a symmetric
	    group on the resolution of a monomial ideal.
	    The symmetric group acts by permuting the four
	    variables of the ring. The conjugacy classes of
	    permutations are determined by their cycle types,
	    which are in bijection with partitions. In this case,
	    we consider five permutations with cycle types,
	    in order: 4, 31, 22, 211, 1111.
	    For simplicity, we construct these matrices
	    by permuting columns of the identity.
    	Example
	    R = QQ[x_1..x_4]
	    I = ideal apply(subsets(gens R,2),product)
	    RI = res I
	    G = { (id_(R^4))_{1,2,3,0},
    		  (id_(R^4))_{1,2,0,3},
    		  (id_(R^4))_{1,0,3,2},
    		  (id_(R^4))_{1,0,2,3},
    		   id_(R^4) }
	    A = action(RI,G,Sub=>false)
    	Text
	    Similarly, setting @TT "Sub=>false"@
	    causes @TO ringActors@ and @TO inverseRingActors@
	    to return the group elements acting on the ring as
	    square matrices. With the default setting
	    @TT "Sub=>true"@, the same elements are returned as
	    one-row substitution matrices.
    	Example
	    ringActors(A,Sub=>false)
	    inverseRingActors(A,Sub=>false)
	    ringActors(A)
