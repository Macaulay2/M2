        development package for beta testing new version of chain complexes    
    Description
        Text
            This package develops new data types and routines for homological algebra.
            Eventually, it will replace the current facilities for homological algebra.
            We are making this available in order to get feedback from users before
            making this change.  Please email the authors with any and all comments or
            suggestions.
        Text
            The major change is replacing the @TO ChainComplex@ data type with @TO Complex@.
            The internal structure of this new data type is somewhat different, but more
            importantly, it has a richer set of constructors.  Use the functions
            @TO (complex, ChainComplex)@, @TO (complex, ChainComplexMap)@, @TO (chainComplex, Complex)@, @TO (chainComplex, ComplexMap)@, 
            to translate between these representations.
        Text
            The overarching goal is to make all of the homological algebra routines functorial.
            For instance, we have @TO2(canonicalMap, "canonical maps")@ associated to kernels,
            cokernels, images, coimages, cones, and cylinders.

    Description
        Text
            In this package, each complex has a concentration {\tt (lo, hi)} 
            such that {\tt lo <= hi}.  When {\tt lo <= i <= hi}, the module
            {\tt C_i} might be zero.  The methods {\tt max} and {\tt min} 
            applied to the complex {\tt C} return {\tt lo} and {\tt hi}, respectively.
      
            This function is mainly used in programming, to loop over all
            non-zero modules or maps in the complex.  This should not be confused
            with the support of a complex.
        Example
            S = ZZ/101[a..c];

            Indices that are outside of the concentration automatically
            return the zero object.

            C_-1
            D_4
        Text
            The function {\tt concentration} does no computation.
            To eliminate extraneous zeros, use @TO (prune,Complex)@.

            concentration E
            concentration prune E
        Text
            The concentration of a zero complex can be arbitrary, however,
            after pruning, its concentration will be {\tt (0,0)}.

        Text
            A complex is a sequence of objects (e.g. modules),
            connected by maps called differentials.  The composition
            of any two consecutive maps is zero.
      
            The same data type is used for both chain and cochain
            complexes.  If {\tt C} is a complex, then we have
            {\tt C^i = C_{-i}}.

            Often, a complex is most easily described by giving a list
            of consecutive maps which form the differential.

            We construct the Koszul complex on the generators for the
            ideal of the twisted cubic curve.
        Example
            S = ZZ/101[a..d]
            I = ideal(b^2-a*c, b*c-a*d, c^2-b*d)
            F1 = map(S^1,,matrix{{I_0, I_1, I_2}})
            F2 = map(source F1,,matrix{
                    {0, I_2, -I_1},
                    {-I_2, 0, I_0},
                    {I_1, -I_0, 0}
                    })
            F3 = map(source F2,,matrix{{I_0}, {I_1}, {I_2}})
            C = complex {F1, F2, F3}
            isWellDefined C
        Text
            To start a complex at a base different from zero, use the
            optional argument {\tt Base}.
        Example
            C1 = complex({F1, F2, F3}, Base => 1)
            isWellDefined C1
        Text
            Notice that this changes the homological degrees of the
            maps, but is not the same as the shift of the complex
            (which for odd shifts negates the maps).
        Example
            dd^C1
            dd^(C[-1])
        Text
            Having constructed this complex, we can access individual
            terms and maps.
        Example
            C_2
            C^(-1)
            C^(-1) == C_1
            C_7
            dd^C
            dd^C_2
            length C
        Text
            By computing the homology of this complex, we see that
            these generators do not form a regular sequence, because
            $H_1(C)$ is non-zero.
        Example
            HH C
            prune HH C
            prune HH_1 C
    Caveat
        This constructor minimizes computation
        and does very little error checking. To verify that a complex

            We illustrate this with a free module.
        Example
            S = ZZ/101[a..d]
            C0 = complex S^2
            f = dd^C0
            source f, target f
            f == 0
            isWellDefined C0
            C0 == 0
            length C0
        Example
            C1 = complex(S^2, Base=>3)
            C1 == C0[-3]
            C1_3
            C1_0
        Text
            A ring or an ideal will be converted to a module first.
        Example
            C2 = complex S
            I = ideal(a^2-b, c^3)
            C3 = complex I
            C4 = complex (S/I)
            (ring C3, ring C4)
        Text
            The zero complex over a ring {\tt S} is most conveniently
            created by giving the zero module.
        Example
            C5 = complex S^0
            C5 == 0
            dd^C5 == 0

      As a first example, we construct by hand the free resolution of the twisted
      cubic.  One must work with maps rather than matrices, because the source and the target
      of adjacent maps must be the same (including degree information).
    Example
      R = QQ[a..d];
      f0 = matrix {{-b^2+a*c, b*c-a*d, -c^2+b*d}}

    Text
      A complex is equal to zero if all the objects and maps are zero.

    Example
      f = id_C

      Testing for equality is not the same testing for isomorphism.
      In particular, different presentations of a complex need not be equal.

    Text
      The shifted complex $D$ is defined by $D_j = C_{i+j}$ for all $j$
      and the sign of the differential is changed if $i$ is odd.
       
      The shifted complex map $g$ is defined by $g_j = f_{i+j}$ for all $j$.
    
      The shift defines a natural automorphism on the category of complexes. 
      Topologists often call the shifted complex $C[1]$ the {\it suspension} of $C$.
    Example
      S = ZZ/101[a..d]
      C = freeResolution coker vars S

      The tensor product is a complex $D$ whose $i$th component is

      The differential on $C1_j \otimes C2_k$ is the differential

      The complex of homomorphisms is a complex $D$ whose $i$th component is

      The differential on $Hom(C1_j, C2_{j+i})$ is the differential

      $dd^{C1} \otimes id_{C2} + (-1)^j id_{C1} \otimes dd^{C2}$.

      In particular, for this operation to be well-defined, both
      arguments must have the same underlying ring.
    Example

     Weights => List
	   a list of integers whose dot product with the multidegree of a basis

   Outputs
     :BettiTally
       a diagram showing the degrees of the generators of the components in {\tt C}
   Description
    Text
      Column $j$ of the top row of the diagram gives the rank of the
      $j$-th component $C_j$ of the complex $C$.  The entry in column $j$ in the row labelled
      $i$ is the number of basis elements of (weighted) degree $i+j$ in $C_j$.
      When the complex is the free resolution of a module the entries are
	  the total and the graded Betti numbers of the module.
      
      As a first example, we consider the ideal 
      in 18 variables which cuts out the variety
      of commuting 3 by 3 matrices.
    Example
      S = ZZ/101[vars(0..17)]
      m1 = genericMatrix(S,a,3,3)
      m2 = genericMatrix(S,j,3,3)
      J = ideal(m1*m2-m2*m1)
      C0 = freeResolution J
      betti C0
    Text
      From the display, we see that $J$ has 8 minimal generators, all
      in degree 2, and that there are 2 linear syzygies on these
      generators, and 31 quadratic syzygies.  
      Since this complex is the free resolution of $S/J$, 
      the projective dimension
      is 6, the index of the last column, and the regularity of $S/J$ is 4, 
      the index of the last row in the diagram.
    Example
      length C0
      pdim betti C0
      regularity betti C0
    Text
      The betti display still makes sense if the complex is not a free resolution.
    Example
      betti dual C0
      C1 = Hom(C0, image matrix{{a,b}});
      betti C1
      C1_-6
    Text
      This module has 10 generators, 2 in degree $-9=(-6)+(-3)$, and 8 in degree $-8=(-6)+(-2)$.
    Text
      In the multi-graded case, the heft vector is used, by default, as the weight vector for weighting the
	  components of the degree vectors of basis elements.
      
      The following example is a nonstandard $\mathbb{Z}$-graded polynomial ring.
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[a,b,c,Degrees=>{-1,-2,-3}];
      heft R
      C2 = freeResolution coker vars R
      betti C2
      betti(C2, Weights => {1})
    Text
      The following example is the Cox ring of the second Hirzebruch surface, and the complex
      is the free resolution of the irrelevant ideal.
    Example
      T = QQ[a,b,c,d,Degrees=>{{1,0},{-2,1},{1,0},{0,1}}];

        Text
            Truncation of homogeneous (graded) modules induces a natural
            operation on chain complexes.
        Text
            In the singly graded case, the truncation of a homogeneous
            module $M$ at degree $d$ is generated by all homogeneous
            elements of degree at least $d$ in $M$.  This method applies
            this operation to each term in a chain complex.  
        Example
            R = QQ[a,b,c];
            I = ideal(a*b, a*c, b*c)
            C = freeResolution I

        Text
            Truncating at a degree less than the minimal generators
            is the identity operation.
        Example
            assert(C == truncate(0, C))
        Text
            In the multi-graded case, the truncation of a homogeneous module at 
            a list of degrees is generated by all homogeneous elements of degree
            that are component-wise greater than or equal to at least one
            of the degrees.
        Example
            A = ZZ/101[x_0, x_1, y_0, y_1, y_2, Degrees => {2:{1,0}, 3:{0,1}}];

    Description
        Text
            This is frequently useful to make the output of certain
            operations readable or understandable.
        Text
            In particular, homology often needs to be pruned to
            be understood.  For instance, this is useful 
            for recognizing when terms given by subquotient modules 
            are actually zero.
        Example
            S = ZZ/101[a,b,c,d,e];
            I = ideal(a,b) * ideal(c,d,e)
            F = dual freeResolution I
            C = HH F
            D = prune C
            g = D.cache.pruningMap
            assert isWellDefined g
            assert isComplexMorphism g
            assert (target g == C)

            h = g^-1
            assert(g*h == 1 and h*g == 1)
        Text
            The image of a map of complexes also becomes more
            understandable via pruning.
        Example
            S = ZZ/101[a,b,c];
            I = ideal(a^2,b^2,c^2);

        Text
            The module $\operatorname{Ext}^d(M,N)$ corresponds to equivalence classes
            of extensions of $N$ by $M$.  In particular, an element 
            of this module is represented by an exact sequence of the form

            The element corresponding to $f$ in $\operatorname{Ext}^d(M,N)$ lifts to 
            the map $g$.

            In our first example, the module

            has one generator, in degree 0.
            The middle term in the corresponding short exact sequence
            determines an irreducible rank 2 vector bundle 
            on the elliptic curve, which can be verified by computing
            Fitting ideals.
