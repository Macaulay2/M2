   Usage

   Inputs 
     M: Module
       graded over a ring of the form S = A[y_0..y_n], representing a sheaf on $\PP^n_A$,
       where A is a polynomial ring.
     Regularity=>ZZ
       the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of {\tt M}.  If not provided, this value will be computed
   Outputs
     F: ChainComplex
       complex of free modules over A. Homology in homological degree -i is 
       $R^i \pi_* {\mathcal M}$, where ${\mathcal M}$ is the sheaf on $\PP^n_A$ represented by M.
   Description
    Text
      The computation is done using the exterior algebra method described by Eisenbud and Schreyer,
      in Eisenbud, David; Schreyer, Frank-Olaf 
      ``Relative Beilinson monad and direct image for families of coherent sheaves.'' 
      Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 360 (2008), no. 10, 5367--5396.
      
      The computation requires knowing the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of M 
      in the variables y_i. If not provided by the user,
      it is computed by the function. The default is Regularity => null, 
      which means it must be computed.
      
      The ring A must be a polynomial ring. For the moment, the module M must be homogeneous
      for the variables of A as well as for the variables of S (bihomogeneous).
      
      It is proven in loc. cit. that every complex of free modules can be realized
      as the direct image of a vector bundle on $\PP^n_A$.
      
      The following example can be used to study the loci in the family of extensions
      of a pair of vector bundles on $\PP^1$ where the extension bundle has a given
      splitting type: this type is calculated by the Fitting ideals of the
      matrices defining the direct image complexes of various twists of the bundle.
      See Section 5 in loc. cite. It is conjectured there that all the sums of
      these Fitting ideals for the universal extension of 
      $\mathcal O_{\PP^1}^{r-1}$ by $\mathcal O_{\PP^1}(d)$ are radical,
      as in the example below.
      
      First we examine the extensions of ${\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}(1)$ by ${\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}(-3)$.
      There is a 3-dimensional vector space 
      $$
      Ext^1({\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}(1),{\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}(-3))
      $$
      of extensions. The ``universal extension'' is thus a bundle on
      $\PP^1\times Ext$. The locus where the extension
      bundle splits as ${\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}(-2) \oplus {\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}$ is the
      locus where the map in the direct image complex drops rank, and this is
      the (cone over a) conic, defined by the determinant of this matrix.
    Example
      M=universalExtension({-3}, {1})
      S = ring M;
      A = coefficientRing S;
      F = directImageComplex M
      F.dd_0
      det (F.dd_0)
    Text
      Here is a larger example, the extension of 
      ${\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}^2$ by ${\mathcal O}_{\PP^1}(6)$

   Description
    Text
     We give an application of this function to create 
     pure free resolutions. A much more general tool for doing
     this is in the script pureResolution.
     
     A "pure free resolution of type (d_0,d_1,..,d_n)" is a resolution of a graded Cohen-Macaulay
     module M over a polynomial ring such that for each 
     i = 1,..,n, the module of i-th syzygies of M is generated by
     syzygies of degree d_i. Eisenbud and Schreyer constructed
     such free resolutions in all characteristics and for all
     degree sequences $d_0 < d_1 < \cdots < d_n$ by pushing forward
     appropriate twists of a Koszul complex. (The construction
     was known for the Eagon-Northcott complex since work of Kempf). 
     
     If one of the 
     differences $d_{i+1} - d_i$ is equal to 1, then it turns out that one of
     the maps in the pure resolution is part of the map of complexes
     directImageComplex k_j, where k_j is a map in this 
     Koszul complex. Here is a simple example, where we produce
     one of the complexes in the family that included the
     Eagon-Northcott complex (see for example "Commutative Algebra
     with a View toward Algebraic Geometry", by D. Eisenbud.)
    Example
     kk = ZZ/101
     A = kk[u,v,w]
     T = A[x,y]
     params = matrix"ux,uy+vx,vy+wx,wy"
     kn = koszul(4,params)
     D = directImageComplex kn
    Text
     The direct image complexes each have only one nonzero
     term,and so D has only one nonzero component. According
     to Eisenbud and Schreyer, this is the last map in a pure
     resolution. Since the dual of a pure resolution is again
     a resolution, we can simply take the dual of this map
     and resolve to see the dual of the resolution (or dualize
     again to see the resolution itself, which is the Eagon-Northcott
     complex itself in this case.

   Outputs

       a minimal free complex representing the direct image complex in the derived category
   Description
    Text
     The method is an elaboration of the exterior algebra method for computing cohomology
     discovered by Eisenbud, Floeystad, Schreyer: Sheaf cohomology and free resolutions over
     exterior algebras. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. (2003).

     We give an application of this function to create generalized Eagon-Northcott complexes,
     discovered by Buchsbaum, Eisenbud, and Kirby, and described in 
     Eisenbud, Commutative Algebra, 1995, section A2.6.  This method can be generalized 
     to produce pure resolutions of any degree sequence.

     These are the complexes associated to a generic 2 by 5 matrix.
    Example
      (p,q) = (2,5) -- number of rows and columns
      A=ZZ/101[a_(0,0)..a_(p-1,q-1)];
      S = A [x_0..x_(p-1)];
      M = sub(map(A^p, A^{q:-1},transpose genericMatrix(A,a_(0,0),q,p)), S)
      Y = map(S^1, S^{q:{-1,-1}}, (vars S)*M)
      F = koszul Y
      L = for i from -1 to q-p+1 list directImageComplex(F**S^{{i,0}});
      L/betti
   Caveat
     This function is not yet functorial, i.e., there is no method to take a map of
     chain complexes and produce the induced map on direct image complexes.
     Additionally, the input ring must be a tower ring with exactly two gradings, and the
     variables must have degree $\{0,1\}$ and $\{1,0\}$
     A later version will remove these restrictions

     Universal extension of vector bundles on P^1
   Usage
     E = universalExtension(La, Lb)
   Inputs

       of integers
     Lb: List 
       of integers
   Outputs 
     E: Module 
       representing the extension
   Description
    Text
     Every vector bundle E on $\PP^1$ splits as a sum of line bundles
     OO(a_i). If La is a list of integers, we write E(La) for the direct sum of the
     line bundle OO(La_i).  Given two such bundles specified by the lists
     La and Lb this script constructs a module representing the universal
     extension of E(Lb) by E(La). It is defined on the product variety
     Ext^1(E(La), E(Lb)) x $\PP^1$, and represented here by
     a graded module over the coordinate ring S = A[y_0,y_1] of this variety;
     here A is the coordinate ring of Ext^1(E(La), E(Lb)), which is a polynomial
     ring.
    Example
     M = universalExtension({-2}, {2})
     M = universalExtension({-2,-3}, {2,3})
    Text
     It is interesting to consider the loci in Ext where the extension has
     a particular splitting type. See the documentation for directImageComplex
     for a conjecture about the equations of these varieties.

     creates a pure resolution as an iterated direct image
   Usage
     F = pureResolution(A, D)
     F = pureResolution(M, D)
     F = pureResolution(p, D)
     F = pureResolution(p,q,D)
   Inputs
     A:Ring
     D:List
     M:Matrix 
       D is a strictly increasing list of integers, the degree sequence
       A is a ring with at least #D-1 variables, the base ring.
       The pure resolution created is the sparse one defined in the
       paper of Eisenbud-Schreyer.
       If M, a matrix over A, is given, then M is used instead
       to construct the resolution (see below).
       If one integer p is given, the program constructs a base ring with the right number of
       variables for the sparse example. If two integers p,q are given, the program
       constructs a base ring of characteristic p and makes a generic system of parameters
       with q elements by taking a generic matrix for M.
   Outputs
     F:ChainComplex
       F will be a pure resolution over A of a module of finite length
       over A, with the desired degree sequence.
       If there are more than #D-1 variables, then a longer resolution
       will be produced, padding the degree sequence at the end
       with consecutive integers.
   Description
    Text
     A "pure free resolution of type (d_0,d_1,..,d_n)" 
     is a resolution of a graded Cohen-Macaulay
     module M over a polynomial ring such that for each 
     i = 1,..,n, the module of i-th syzygies of M is generated by
     syzygies of degree d_i. Eisenbud and Schreyer constructed
     such free resolutions in all characteristics and for all
     degree sequences $d_0 < d_1 < \cdots < d_n$ by pushing forward
     appropriate twists of a Koszul complex. (The construction
     was known for the Eagon-Northcott complex since work of Kempf).

     The script allows several variations including a sparse version 
     and a generic version.
     
     Here is a simple example, where we produce
     one of the complexes in the family that included the
     Eagon-Northcott complex (see for example the appendix in
     "Commutative Algebra with a View toward Algebraic Geometry"
     by D. Eisenbud.) This way of producing the Eagon-Northcott 
     complex was certainly known to George Kempf, who may have invented it.
    Example
     kk = ZZ/101
     A = kk[u,v,w]
     T = A[x,y]
     params = matrix"ux,uy+vx,vy+wx,wy"
     kn = koszul(params)
     directImageComplex kn
    Text
     If we twist the map kn a little before taking the direct image
     we get other complexes in a family that also includes
     the Buchsbaum-Rim complex (see Eisenbud, loc. cit.)
    Example
     for d from -1 to 3 do 
       (print betti directImageComplex (T^{{d,0}}**kn);print())
    Text
     For more complex examples, we use the function 
     {\tt pureResolution}, which creates a Koszul complex over a product of
     projective spaces over a ground ring A and (iteratively) forms the direct image over A.
     In the following
     we specify a ground ring A and a degree sequence.
    Example
     A = kk[a,b,c]
     betti (pureResolution(A,{1,3,4,6}))
    Text
     If one doesn't want to bother creating the ring, it suffices to give the characteristic.
    Example
     betti (F = pureResolution(11,{0,2,4}))
     describe ring F
    Text
     With the form {\tt pureResolution(M,D)}
     It is possible to specify a matrix M of linear forms in the ground ring A that
     defines the parameters used in the Koszul complex whose direct image is taken.
     The matrix M in pureResolution(M,D) 
     should have size product(m_i+1) x q, where
     the m_i+1 are the successive differences of the entries of D that happen to be >1, and
     q >= #D-1+sum(m_i).(The m_i are the dimensions of the projective spaces from whose product
     we are projecting.)
    Example
     A = kk[a,b]
     M = random(A^4, A^{4:-1})
     time betti (F = pureResolution(M,{0,2,4}))
    Text
     With the form {\tt pureResolution(p,q,D)}
     we can directly create the situation of {\tt pureResolution(M,D)} where M is
     generic 
     product(m_i+1) x #D-1+sum(m_i) 
     matrix of linear forms defined over a ring with product(m_i+1) * #D-1+sum(m_i) 
     variables of characteristic p, created by the script. For a given number of
     variables in A this runs much faster than taking a random matrix M.
    Example
     time betti (F = pureResolution(11,4,{0,2,4}))
