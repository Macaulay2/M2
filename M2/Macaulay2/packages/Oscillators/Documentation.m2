    This package supports computations with Kuramoto oscillators,
    including computations for the paper [HSS], Harrington, Schenck,
    Stillman, @arXiv("2312.16069", "Algebraic aspects of homogeneous
    Kuramoto oscillators")@.  For a list of functions, and links to their documentation

    We show a possible workflow using this package.  We use @TO "NautyGraphs::NautyGraphs"@
    to generate graphs of small size.  We use @TO "Visualize::Visualize"@ to look at these graphs.
  Example

    needsPackage "NautyGraphs";
    needsPackage "Visualize";
  Text
    Let's do an example: the 5-cycle.  First, we generate all SCT graphs on 5 vertices (i.e. connected, 2-connected simple graphs),
    and grab the 5-cycle.
  Example
    Gstrs = generateGraphs(5, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
    Gs = Gstrs/stringToGraph
    Gcycle5 = Gs_3
  Text
    We can also create the graph directly.
  Example
    Gcycle5 == graph{{0,1},{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{4,0}}

    To visualize this graph, use the following lines.  You have to click on End session

    We construct all of the (steady-state) solutions to the homogeneous Kuramoto system for the 5-cycle.
    This includes all solutions, not just stable solutions.
    In this example, we first construct the real solutions, and check their (linear) stability.
    Then we find all complex solutions.  In this particular example, all 30 solutions are real.
    We set the precision displayed to 3 digits.
  Example
    printingPrecision = 3
    G = Gcycle5
    R = oscRing(G, CoefficientRing => CC, Reduced => true)
    I = oscSystem(G, R);
    netList I_*
    Jac = oscJacobian(G,R)
    realsols = findRealSolutions I;
    netList realsols
    assert(# realsols == 30)
    stablesols = select(realsols, p -> Stable === identifyStability(Jac,p))
    tally realsols/(p -> identifyStability(Jac, p))
    getAngles(4, stablesols, Radians=>false)
    sols = solveSystem I_*;
    sols = sols/coordinates;
    sols = matrix sols -- every row is a solution
    sols = clean(1e-6, sols) -- set to 0 numbers very close to 0
    assert(numrows sols == 30) -- all the solutions in this example are real

  Description
    Text
      $R$ should be a ring created with @TO "oscRing"@.  The dynamical system
      involved is the oscillator system associated to $G$: one angle per vertex.
      If $a_{ij} = 1$ if $(i,j)$ is an edge of the undirected graph $G$, 
      and is zero otherwise, then the system is $d\theta_i/dt = \sum_j a_{ij} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i)$
      where we consider only reduced equilibrium solutions $\theta_0 = 0$.
      
      This function returns the ideal of equilibrium points, where angles $(0, \theta_1, ..., \theta_{n-1})$
      are represented via cosines and sines of the angles.

      eigenvalues lift(sub(M, x_3=>100), QQ)
  Caveat
    If the system is positive dimensional, then of course it won't find all roots. There might be
    real roots on a component, but none are found. If a component (even a point) is singular, then
    it might have problems, depending on the situation. In the latter case, there
    is a warning message emitted (about non-regular solutions).

    and returns all of the stable solutions found.

    Note: The methods {\tt getExoticSolutions} and {\tt showExoticSolutions} are the same, for historical reasons.
    
    The warning that there are non-regular solutions generally means that it has come across a positive dimensional
    solution set while looking for solutions.  No such solutions can be linearly stable, so the warning is generally not relevant.

    "Generation of all SCT (simple, connected, 2-connected) graphs on small numbers of vertices"
  Headline
    generating all SCT graphs on n vertices
  Description
    Text
      Using the NautyGraphs package, we generate the list of
      isomorphism classes of the SCT (simple, connected, 2-connected)
      graphs with a fixed number of vertices.
    Example
      needsPackage "Oscillators"
      needsPackage "NautyGraphs"
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(5, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      #Gstrs == 11
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(6, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      #Gstrs == 61
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(7, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      #Gstrs == 507
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(8, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      #Gstrs == 7442
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(9, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      #Gstrs == 197772
    Text
      Here is a simple table with all of these numbers.

    "Checking the codimension and irreducible decomposion of the IG ideal"
  Headline
    generating all SCT graphs on n vertices
  Description
    Text
      We first construct the ideal $I_G$ for a specific graph $G$ on 5 vertices.
      We use the 5-cycle as the specific example.
    Example
      needsPackage "Oscillators"
      needsPackage "NautyGraphs"
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(5, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      Gs = Gstrs/stringToGraph
      G = Gs_3
      R = oscRing(5, Reduced => false);
      IG = oscQuadrics(G, R)
      netList IG_*
      codim IG
    Text
      Each $I_G$ on $n$ vertices has $n-1$ minimal generators.
      This particular $I_G$ has the same codimension $n-1=4$, so is a complete intersection.
      This ideal decomposes as an intersection of 2 prime ideals.
    Example
      comps = decompose IG;
      netList comps_0_*, netList comps_1_*
      comps/codim
      comps/degree
      comps/isPrime
    Text
      Let's see how many graphs are not complete intersections, i.e. have codimension
      $\le n-2$.
    Example
      # select(Gs, G -> (
          IG = oscQuadrics(G, R);
          codim IG <= #vertices G - 2
          ))
    Example
      for G in Gs list (
          IG = oscQuadrics(G, R);
          elapsedTime comps := decompose IG;
          {comps/codim, comps/degree}
          );
      netList oo
    Example
      n = 6
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(n, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      Gs = Gstrs/stringToGraph;
      R = oscRing(n, Reduced => false);
      # select(Gs, G -> (
          IG = oscQuadrics(G, R);
          codim IG <= #vertices G - 2
          ))
    Example
      allcomps = for G in Gs list (
          IG = oscQuadrics(G, R);
          elapsedTime comps := decompose IG;
          {comps/codim, comps/degree}
          );
      netList ({{"codimensions", "degrees"}} | allcomps)

      n = 7
      Gstrs = generateGraphs(n, OnlyConnected => true, MinDegree => 2);
      Gs = Gstrs/stringToGraph;

      # select(Gs, G -> (
          IG = oscQuadrics(G, R);
          elapsedTime codim IG <= #vertices G - 2
          ))
