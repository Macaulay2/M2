        working with normal toric varieties and related objects
    Description
    	Text
            A toric variety is an integral scheme such that an algebraic torus
            forms a Zariski open subscheme and the natural action this torus
            on itself extends to an action on the entire scheme.  Normal toric
            varieties correspond to strongly convex rational polyhedral fans.
            This makes the theory of normal toric varieties very explicit and
            computable.

            This {\em Macaulay2} package is designed to manipulate normal
            toric varieties and related geometric objects.  An introduction to
            the theory of normal toric varieties can be found in the following

        the class of all normal toric varieties
    Description
        Text  
            A normal toric variety corresponds to a strongly convex rational
            polyhedral fan.  In this package, the fan associated to a normal
            $d$-dimensional toric variety lies in the rational vector space
            $\QQ^d$ with underlying lattice $N = \ZZ^d$.  The fan is encoded
            by the minimal nonzero lattice points on its rays and the set of
            rays defining the maximal cones (a maximal cone is not properly
            contained in another cone in the fan).  More information about the
            correspondence between normal toric varieties and strongly convex
            rational polyhedral fans appears in Subsection 3.1 of
            Cox-Little-Schenck.
    Caveat 
	To sidestep edge case issues, this package excludes some normal toric
        varieties.  To avoid the $0$-dimensional vector space, all normal
        toric varieties in this package have positive dimension.  Similarly,
        to circumvent the empty set of rays, all normal toric varieties in
        this package have an orbit other than the dense algebraic

    Description
        Text	
            This is the main method for constructing a normal toric
            variety.  Almost all other constructors invoke it.
        Text
            A normal toric variety corresponds to a strongly convex rational
            polyhedral fan in affine space.  In this package, the fan
            associated to a normal $d$-dimensional toric variety lies in the
            rational vector space $\QQ^d$ with underlying lattice $N = \ZZ^d$.
            The fan is encoded by the minimal nonzero lattice points on its
            rays and the set of rays defining the maximal cones (meaning cones
            that are not proper subsets of another cone in the fan).  More
            precisely, {\tt rayList} lists the minimal nonzero lattice points
            on each ray (a.k.a. one-dimensional cone) in the fan. Each lattice
            point is a @TO2(List,"list")@ of @TO2(ZZ,"integers")@. The rays
            are ordered and indexed by nonnegative integers: $0,1,\dots,n$.
            Using this indexing, a maximal cone in the fan corresponds to a
            sublist of $\{0,1,\dots,n\}$.  All maximal cones are listed in
            {\tt coneList}.  More information explaining the correspondence
            between normal toric varieties and strongly convex rational
            polyhedral fans appears in Subsection 3.1 of Cox-Little-Schenck.
        Text
            The first example is projective plane blown up at two points.
        Example
            rayList = {{1,0},{0,1},{-1,1},{-1,0},{0,-1}}
            coneList = {{0,1},{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{0,4}}
    	    X = normalToricVariety (rayList, coneList)
            rays X
            max X
            dim X
	    assert (isWellDefined X and isProjective X and isSmooth X)
        Text
            The second example illustrates the data defining projective
            $4$-space.
        Example	    
            PP4 = toricProjectiveSpace 4;
            rays PP4
            max PP4
            dim PP4
            ring PP4
            PP4' = normalToricVariety (rays PP4, max PP4, CoefficientRing => ZZ/32003, Variable => y)
            ring PP4'
	    assert (isWellDefined PP4 and isProjective PP4 and isSmooth PP4)
        Text
            The optional argument {\tt WeilToClass} allows one to specify the
            map from the @TO2(weilDivisorGroup, "group of torus-invariant Weil
            divisors")@ to the @TO2(classGroup, "class group")@.  In
            particular, this allows the user to choose her favourite basis for
            the class group.  This map also determines the grading on the
            @TO2((ring, NormalToricVariety), "total coordinate ring")@ of the
            normal toric variety.  For example, we can choose the opposite
            generator for the class group of projective space as follows.
        Example  
            PP2 = toricProjectiveSpace 2;
            A = fromWDivToCl PP2
            source A == weilDivisorGroup PP2
            target A == classGroup PP2
            degrees ring PP2
            deg = matrix {toList (3:-1)}
            X = normalToricVariety (rays PP2, max PP2, WeilToClass => deg);
            A' = fromWDivToCl X
            source A' == weilDivisorGroup X
            target A' == classGroup X	  
            degrees ring X
            (matrix A') * (matrix rays X)
	    assert (isWellDefined X and isProjective X and isSmooth X)
        Text
            The integer matrix {\tt A} should span the kernel of the matrix
            whose columns are the minimal nonzero lattice points on the rays
            of the fan.

            We can also choose a basis for the class group of a blow-up of the
            projective plane such that the nef cone is the positive quadrant.
        Example  
            rayList = {{1,0},{0,1},{-1,1},{-1,0},{0,-1}};
            coneList = {{0,1},{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{0,4}};
            Y = normalToricVariety (rayList, coneList);
            fromWDivToCl Y
            nefGenerators Y
            deg = matrix{{1,-1,1,0,0},{0,1,-1,1,0},{0,0,1,-1,1}}
            Y' = normalToricVariety (rays Y, max Y, WeilToClass => deg);	  
            fromWDivToCl Y'
            nefGenerators Y'
	    assert (isWellDefined Y and isWellDefined Y')
    Caveat
        This method assumes that the lists {\tt rayList} and {\tt coneList}
        correctly encode a strongly convex rational polyhedral fan.  One can
        verify this by using @TO(isWellDefined, NormalToricVariety)@.

	    A normal toric variety corresponds to a strongly convex rational
            polyhedral fan in affine space.  In this package, the fan
            associated to a normal $d$-dimensional toric variety lies in the
            rational vector space $\QQ^d$ with underlying lattice $N =
            {\ZZ}^d$.  As a result, each ray in the fan is determined by the
            minimal nonzero lattice point it contains.  Each such lattice
            point is given as a @TO2(List, "list")@ of $d$ @TO2(ZZ,
            "integers")@.  
	Text

            @TO2(hirzebruchSurface, "Hirzebruch surface")@, and a 
	    @TO2(weightedProjectiveSpace, "weighted projective space")@.	    
            There is a canonical bijection between the rays and
            torus-invariant Weil divisor on the toric variety.

    Description
        Text
            A normal toric variety corresponds to a strongly convex rational
            polyhedral fan in affine space.  In this package, the fan
            associated to a normal $d$-dimensional toric variety lies in the
            rational vector space $\QQ^d$ with underlying lattice $N = \ZZ^d$.
            The fan is encoded by the minimal nonzero lattice points on its
            rays and the set of rays defining the maximal cones (where a
            maximal cone is not properly contained in another cone in the
            fan).  The rays are ordered and indexed by nonnegative integers:
            $0, 1, \dots, n-1$.  Using this indexing, a maximal cone in the fan
            corresponds to a sublist of $\{ 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \}$; the entries
            index the rays that generate the cone.

            A normal toric variety is a disjoint union of its orbits under the

            Given a normal toric variety, this method makes a simplicial toric
  	    variety with the same rays by triangulating the non-simplicial
  	    maximal cones.  For the {\tt 0} strategy, the triangulation is
  	    constructed by repeated regular subdivisions using random integral
  	    weight vectors.  For the {\tt 1} strategy, the triangulation is
  	    constructed by repeated pushing subdivisions (i.e. toricBlowups at a
  	    given ray).
        Example  
            X = normalToricVariety (id_(ZZ^3) | - id_(ZZ^3));
    	    assert not isSimplicial X
    	    Y1 = makeSimplicial X;

            If the initial toric variety is simplicial, then this method

        toricBlowup (s, X, v)

	    of integers indexing a proper torus orbit
        X : NormalToricVariety

    Description
        Text	    
            Roughly speaking, the toricBlowup replaces a subspace of a given space
  	    with all the directions pointing out of that subspace.  The
  	    metaphor is inflation of a balloon rather than an explosion.  A
  	    toricBlowup is the universal way to turn a subvariety into a Cartier
  	    divisor.
        Text  
            The toricBlowup of a normal toric variety along a torus orbit closure
  	    is also a normal toric variety.  The fan associated to the toricBlowup
  	    is star subdivision or stellar subdivision of the fan of the
  	    original toric variety.  More precisely, we throw out the star of
  	    the cone corresponding to {\tt s} and join a vector {\tt v} lying
  	    the relative interior to the boundary of the star.  When the
  	    vector {\tt v} is not specified, the ray corresponding to the sum
  	    of all rays in the cone corresponding to {\tt s} is used.
        Text  
            The simplest example is toricBlowup of the origin in the affine plane.
  	    Note that the new ray has the largest index.
        Example    
            AA2 = affineSpace 2;
    	    rays AA2
    	    max AA2
    	    Bl0 = toricBlowup ({0,1}, AA2);

  	    Here are a few different toricBlowups of a non-simplicial affine toric

        Text 
            The third collection of examples illustrate some toricBlowups of a
  	    non-simplicial projective toric variety.
        Example 	    
    	    X = normalToricVariety (id_(ZZ^3) | (-id_(ZZ^3)));
    	    rays X
    	    max X
    	    assert (not isSimplicial X and isProjective X)
    	    orbits (X,1)
    	    Bl5 = toricBlowup ({0,2}, X);
    	    Bl6 = toricBlowup ({6,7}, Bl5);
    	    Bl7 = toricBlowup ({1,5}, Bl6);
    	    rays Bl7
    	    max Bl7
    	    assert (isSimplicial Bl7 and isProjective Bl7)
    	    Bl8 = toricBlowup ({0}, X);
    	    Bl9 = toricBlowup ({7}, Bl8);
    	    assert (rays Bl9 === rays X)
    	    assert (isSimplicial Bl9 and isProjective Bl9)
    Caveat 
        The method assumes that the list {\tt v} corresponds to a primitive
  	vector.  In other words, the greatest common divisor of its entries is
  	one.  The method also assumes that {\tt v} lies in the relative
  	interior of the cone corresponding to {\tt s}.  If either of these
  	conditions fail, then the output will not necessarily be a
  	well-defined normal toric variety.

            Every normal toric variety has a resolution of singularities given

  	    this method makes a new smooth toric variety $Y$ which has a
  	    proper birational map to $X$.  The normal toric variety $Y$ is
  	    obtained from $X$ by repeatedly blowing up appropriate torus orbit
  	    closures (if necessary the @TO makeSimplicial@ method is also used
  	    with the specified strategy).  A minimal number of blow-ups are

            As a simple example, we can resolve a simplicial affine
            singularity.
        Example 	    
    	    U = normalToricVariety ({{4,-1},{0,1}}, {{0,1}});
    	    assert not isSmooth U
    	    V = makeSmooth U;
    	    assert isSmooth V
    	    rays V, max V
    	    toList (set rays V - set rays U)
        Text 
            There is one additional rays, so only one toricBlowup was needed.
        Text 
  	    To resolve the singularities of this simplicial projective
  	    fourfold, we need eleven toricBlowups.
        Example  
    	    W = weightedProjectiveSpace {1,2,3,4,5};
    	    assert (dim W === 4)
    	    assert (isSimplicial W and not isSmooth W)
    	    W' = makeSmooth W;
    	    assert isSmooth W'
    	    # (set rays W' - set rays W)
        Text
            If the initial toric variety is smooth, then this method simply
  	    returns it.
        Example   
    	    AA1 = affineSpace 1;
    	    assert (AA1 === makeSmooth AA1)
    	    PP2 = toricProjectiveSpace 2;
    	    assert (PP2 === makeSmooth PP2)
        Text
            In the next example, we resolve the singularities of a
  	    non-simplicial projective threefold.
        Example 	    
    	    X = normalToricVariety (id_(ZZ^3) | -id_(ZZ^3));
    	    assert (not isSimplicial X and not isSmooth X)
    	    X' = makeSmooth X;
    	    assert isSmooth X'
    	    # (set rays X' - set rays X)
        Text	    
  	    We also demonstrate this method on a complete simplicial
  	    non-projective threefold.
        Example  
    	    Z = normalToricVariety ({{-1,-1,1},{3,-1,1},{0,0,1},{1,0,1},{0,1,1},{-1,3,1},{0,0,-1}}, {{0,1,3},{0,1,6},{0,2,3},{0,2,5},{0,5,6},{1,3,4},{1,4,5},{1,5,6},{2,3,4},{2,4,5}});
    	    assert (isSimplicial Z and not isSmooth Z)
	    assert (isComplete Z and not isProjective Z)
    	    Z' = makeSmooth Z;
    	    assert isSmooth Z'
    	    # (set rays Z' - set rays Z)
        Text
  	    We end with a degenerate example.
        Example	    
            Y = normalToricVariety ({{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,1,0},{1,-1,1,0},{1,0,-2,0}}, {{0,1,2,3},{0,4}});
    	    assert (isDegenerate Y and not isSimplicial Y and not isComplete Y)
    	    Y' = makeSmooth Y;
    	    assert isSmooth Y'
	    # (set rays Y' - set rays Y)
    Caveat 
        A singular normal toric variety almost never has a unique minimal
	resolution.  This method returns only of one of the many minimal
	resolutions.
