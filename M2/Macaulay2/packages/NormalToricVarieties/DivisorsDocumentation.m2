	    For a normal toric variety, the class group has a presentation
            defined by the map from the group of torus-characters to group of
            torus-invariant Weil divisors induced by minimal nonzero lattice
            points on the rays of the associated fan.  Hence, there is a
            surjective map from the group of torus-invariant Weil divisors to
            the class group.  This method returns a matrix representing this
            map.  Since the ordering on the rays of the toric variety
            determines a basis for the group of torus-invariant Weil divisors,
            this matrix is determined by a choice of basis for the class
            group.  For more information, see Theorem 4.1.3 in

	    The group of torus-invariant Cartier divisors on $X$ is the

            On a normal toric variety, the group of torus-invariant Cartier
            divisors can be computed as an inverse limit.  More precisely, if
            $M$ denotes the lattice of characters on $X$ and the maximal cones
            in the fan of $X$ are $sigma_0, sigma_1, \dots, sigma_{r-1}$, then
            we have $CDiv(X) = ker( \oplus_{i} M/M(sigma_i{}) \to{}
            \oplus_{i<j} M/M(sigma_i \cap sigma_j{})$.  For more information,

	    When the underlying normal toric variety has not been assigned a

            divisor is displayed as $D_i$.  However, if the underlying normal

            irreducible torus-invariant Weil divisor is displayed as $X_i$.

    Description
        Text
            Given a list of integers and a normal toric variety, this method
            returns the torus-invariant Weil divisor such the coefficient of
            the $i$-th irreducible torus-invariant divisor is the $i$-th entry
            in the list.  The indexing of the irreducible torus-invariant
            divisors is inherited from the indexing of the rays in the
            associated fan.  In this package, the rays are ordered and indexed
            by the nonnegative integers.
	Example
            PP2 = toricProjectiveSpace 2;
    	    D = toricDivisor({2,-7,3},PP2)
            assert(D == 2* PP2_0 - 7*PP2_1 + 3*PP2_2)

    	Text
            Although this is a general method for making a torus-invariant
            Weil divisor, it is typically more convenient to simple enter the
            appropriate linear combination of torus-invariant Weil divisors.

    Description
        Text			       
            On a smooth normal toric variety, the canonical divisor equals
            minus the sum of all the torus-invariant irreducible divisors.
            For a singular toric variety, this divisor may not be Cartier or
            even $\QQ$-Cartier.  Nevertheless, the associated coherent sheaf,
            whose local sections are rational functions with at least simple
            zeros along the irreducible divisors, is the dualizing sheaf.
	Text
	    The first example illustrates the canonical divisor on projective
	    space.
    	Example	    
    	    PP3 = toricProjectiveSpace 3;
	    assert(isSmooth PP3 and isProjective PP3)
    	    K = toricDivisor PP3

	Text
            The second example illustrates that duality also holds on complete
            singular nonprojective toric varieties.
	Example 
            X = normalToricVariety({{1,0,0},{0,1,0},{0,0,1},{0,-1,-1},{-1,0,-1},{-2,-1,0}},{{0,1,2},{0,1,3},{1,3,4},{1,2,4},{2,4,5},{0,2,5},{0,3,5},{3,4,5}});

            Two Weil divisors $D$ and $E$ are linearly equivalent if 
	    $D = E + div(f)$, for some $f \in {\mathbb C}(X)^*$. Linearly
            equivalent divisors produce isomorphic sheaves.

        Text
            A torus-invariant Weil divisor $D$ on a normal toric variety $X$
            is Cartier if it is locally principal, meaning that $X$ has an
            open cover $\{U_i\}$ such that $D|_{U_i}$ is principal in $U_i$

            On a simplicial toric variety, every torus-invariant Weil divisor
            is $\QQ$-Cartier, which means that every torus-invariant Weil
            divisor has a positive integer multiple that is Cartier.

            W = weightedProjectiveSpace {2,5,7};

  	    contained in the associated polytope.  For a non-effective Cartier
  	    divisor, this method returns @TO null@.
        Text  
            On the projective plane, the associate polytope is either empty, a
   	    point, or a triangle.
        Example
            PP2 = toricProjectiveSpace 2;
    	    assert (null === vertices (-PP2_0))
    	    latticePoints (0*PP2_0)
    	    assert isAmple PP2_0
    	    V1 = latticePoints (PP2_0)
    	    X1 = normalToricVariety V1;
    	    assert (set rays X1 === set rays PP2 and  max X1 === max PP2)
    	    assert isAmple (2*PP2_0)
    	    V2 = latticePoints (2*PP2_0)
    	    X2 = normalToricVariety(V2, MinimalGenerators => true);
    	    assert (rays X2 === rays X1 and max X2 === max X1)

            In this singular example, we see that all the lattice points in
  	    the polytope arising from a divisor $2D$ do not come from the
  	    lattice points in the polytope arising from $D$.
        Example  
            Y = normalToricVariety matrix {{0,1,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0,1},{0,0,0,1,1},{0,0,0,0,3}};
    	    D = 3*Y_0;
    	    latticePoints D
    	    latticePoints (2*D)

        makes the associated 'Polyhedra' polyhedron
    Usage 
        polytope D
    Inputs
        D : ToricDivisor
    Outputs 
        : Polyhedron
    Description
        Text
            For a torus-invariant Weil divisors $D = \sum_i a_i D_i$ the
            associated polyhedron is 
	    $\{ m \in M : (m, v_i) \geq -a_i \forall i \}$.	    
            Given a torus-invariant Weil divisor, this methods makes the
  	    associated polyhedra as an object in @TO Polyhedra@.
        Example  
    	    PP2 = toricProjectiveSpace 2;
    	    P0 = polytope (-PP2_0)
	    assert (dim P0 === -1)
    	    P1 = polytope (0*PP2_0)
	    assert (dim P1 == 0)
	    assert (vertices P1 == 0)
    	    P2 = polytope (PP2_0)
    	    vertices P2
	    halfspaces P2
        Text	    
            This method works with $\QQ$-Cartier divisors.
        Example  	    
    	    Y = normalToricVariety matrix {{0,1,0,0,1},{0,0,1,0,1},{0,0,0,1,1},{0,0,0,0,3}};
    	    assert not isCartier Y_0
    	    assert isQQCartier Y_0
    	    P3 = polytope Y_0;
	    vertices P3
    	    vertices polytope Y_0
	    halfspaces P3
        Text	    
  	    It also works divisors on non-complete toric varieties.
       Example	    
           Z = normalToricVariety ({{1,0},{1,1},{0,1}}, {{0,1},{1,2}});
    	   assert not isComplete Z
    	   D = - toricDivisor Z
    	   P4 = polytope D;
	   rays P4
    	   vertices P4
	   halfspaces P4
