    a package for distributed computation of Gr\"obner bases
  Description
    Text
      The complexity of Gr\"obner computations has inspired many improvements to Buchberger's
      algorithm over the years.
      While this package does not propose an improvement to the way the algorithm operates mathematically,
      it offers a way to distribute the algorithm among threads that run in parallel.
      It is our hope that such a distributed version of the algorithm should be written in the core of the program;
      however, there are still important insights one can obtain from the current implementation.

      To us, the most interesting is the insight into {\it lineages} (see below) of non-zero remainders
      that are added to the basis during a run of Buchberger. How are these affected by the structure of the
      input system? What do they say about the complexity of the computation itself (and not only the complexity
      of the basis)? These are questions at the heart of what we are aiming to discover, and the output of the
      threaded Gr\"obner bases method @TO tgb@ returns this information in form of a {\bf lineage table}.
    Example
      QQ[x_1,x_0,x_3,x_5,x_4,x_2,MonomialOrder=>Lex]
      rnc = minors(2, matrix{{x_0..x_4},{x_1..x_5}})
      allowableThreads  =  4
      g = tgb(rnc)
    Text
      The lineage table is a hash table, whose values are Gr\"obner basis elements, and whose keys are the {\it lineages}.

      {\bf Definition.} A lineage of a polynomial is a natural number, or an ordered pair of lineages, tracing 
      its history in the given Gr\"obner basis computation.

      Lineages that are natural numbers are assigned to the original input polynomials.
      In the example above, the 10 minors have lineages $0,\dots,9$. 
    Example
      g#1
      g#2
    Text
      If the S-polynomial of g#"i" and g#"j" produces a non-zero remainder in Buchberger's algorithm,
      that remainder is added to the hashtable g with key (i-j), as in the following example.
    Example
      g#(1,2)
    Text
      As the algorithm continues, keys are concatenated, so that for example the remainder of S(0,S(1,2)) will
      have lineage (0,(1,2)), and so on.   For more complicated lineage examples, see @TO tgb@.

      Naturally, one can obtain
      a minimal basis or the reduced one as follows. In the output below, elements that are reduced
      are replaced by null, but their lineage keys are retained for informative purposes.
    Example
      minimize g
      gRed = reduce g
    Text
      To get the Gr\"obner basis in standard M2 matrix format, simply call the following:
    Example
      matrix gRed
    Text
      {\bf Nuts and Bolts}

      The main function,  @TO tgb@, uses  @TO Task@s to distribute the reduction of S-polynomials using a
      a current version of the Groenber basis.
      It can reduce and minimize upon request or print out  task scheduling information
      as it creates new tasks.
      The interesting part of the output may be the lineages of the basis polynomials,
      in addition to the Gr\"obner basis itself.
      Here is an example where the Gr\"obner basis is trivial.
    Example
      QQ[a..d]
      I=ideal( -c^3+a^2+b*d, a*b*c-1,a*b*c)
      allowableThreads =  2;
      T = tgb(I,Verbose=>true)
      allowableThreads = 1;
    Text
      In particular, the lineages of null values tell us what S-polynomials didn't reduce to zero until $1$ was found as
      a remainder.

  Usage
    tgb(List)
    tgb(Ideal)
  Inputs
    L : List
      of polynomials
    I : Ideal
  Outputs
    : LineageTable
      a hashtable whose values are a Gr\"obner basis for the ideal {\tt I} or the ideal generated by {\tt L},
      and keys are the lineages of the corresponding elements.
  Description
    Text
      Threaded Gr\"obner basis uses  @TO Task@s to compute a Gr\"obner basis of {\tt I} or {\tt ideal L}
      using $n$ threads.
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[x,y,z, MonomialOrder=>Lex];
      I = ideal {2*x + 10*y^2*z, 8*x^2*y + 10*x*y*z^3, 5*x*y^3*z^2 + 9*x*z^3, 9*x*y^3*z + 10*x*y^3};
      allowableThreads  = 4;
      H = tgb I
    Text
      The keys of the hashtable are meaningful; for example, the polynomial with key
      {\tt ((0,2),1)} in the hashtable {\tt tgb(L,n)} is the remainder upon division of the S-polynomial $(g, I_1)$,
      where $g$ is calculated from the S-pair $(I_0, I_2)$.
      For this reason, we say that the key communicates the "lineage" of the resulting polynomial.
      (See @TO ThreadedGB@.)

      Note that the keys in the hash table are strings, and the keys of input polynomials are 0..#L, as in the following example.
    Example
      H#(0,1)
    Text
      Some may be curious  how tgb works.

      The starting basis $L$ (the input list {\tt L} or {\tt L=gens I})
      populates the entries numbered $0$ through $n-1$ of a mutable hash table $G$, where  $n$ is the length of $L$. 
      The method creates all possible
      S-polynomials of $L$ and schedules their reduction with respect to $G$ as tasks.
      Throughout the computation, every nonzero remainder added to the basis is added to $G$
      with its lineage as the key. Each such remainder also triggers the creation of S-polynomials
      using it and every element in $G$ and scheduling the reduction thereof as additional tasks.
      The process is done when there are no remaining tasks.

      There is a way to track the tasks being created by turning on the option {\tt Verbose}.
    Example
      QQ[a..d];
      f0 = a*b-c^2;
      f1 = b*c-d^2;
      allowableThreads=2;
      tgb({f0,f1},Verbose=>true)
    Text
      In the example above, the S-polynomial S(f0,f1) didn't reduce to zero, hence the remainder was added to the
      output with key (0,1). The additional two S-polynomials reduced and the process ended.

    minimize
    reduce
  Caveat
    Due to threads running in parallel, it can happen that there are redundant elements in the final
    Gr\"obner basis. However these can be easily removed using @TO minimize@, for example.
    
    Also, {\tt  allowableThreads} needs to be set to an integer larger than 1, prior to calling @TO tgb@.
    Otherwise, errors may occur. It may be a good idea to reset allowableThreads to 1 after the threaded computations are done.

  Description
    Text
      This simple function just returns the Gr\"obner basis computed with threaded Gr\"obner basis function @TO tgb@
      in the expected Macaulay2 format, so that further computation are one step easier to set up.
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[a,b,c];
      allowableThreads= 2;
      T = reduce tgb( ideal "abc+c2,ab2-b3c+ac,b2")
      matrix T

    Option to specify whether additional output is wanted.
  Usage
    tgb(...,Verbose=>Boolean)
  Description
    Text
      Use {\tt Verbose=>True} as an argument in the function @TO tgb@
      for additional output, including information
      about each new generated thread (i.e., each new S-polynomial reduction
      computation) as well as each new Gr\"obner basis element added to the current basis.
      Lineages are reported as well.
    Example
      S = QQ[x,y,z,w];
      allowableThreads= 2;
      tgb({x*y-z^2,y*z-w^2},Verbose=>true);

    Option to specify whether the end Gr\"obner basis should be a minimal Gr\"obner basis
  Usage
    tgb(...,Minimal=>Boolean)
  Description
    Text
      Use {\tt Minimal=>True} as an argument in the function @TO tgb@
      for ensure the resulting Gr\"obner basis is minimized.
      Lineages of non-minimal Gr\"obner basis elements that were added to the basis during the
      distributed computation are saved, with the corresponding entry in the table being null.
    Example
      S = ZZ/101[a,b,c];
      allowableThreads= 2;
      T = tgb( ideal "abc+c2,ab2-b3c+ac,b2", Minimal=>true)
    Text
      By default, the option is false. The basis can also be minimized after the distributed computation
      is finished:
    Example
      T = tgb( ideal "abc+c2,ab2-b3c+ac,b2")
      minimize T
