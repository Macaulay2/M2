    a package for distributed computation of Groebner bases
  Description
    Text
      The complexity of Groebner computations has inspired many improvements to Buchberger's
      algorithm over the years.
      While this package does not propose an improvement to the way the algorithm operates mathematically,
      it offers a way to distribute the algorithm among threads that run in parallel.
      It is our hope that such a distributed version of the algorithm should be written in the core of the program;
      however, there are still important insights one can obtain from the current implementation.

      To us, the most interesting is the insight into {\it lineages} (see below) of non-zero remainders
      that are added to the basis during a run of Buchberger. How are these affected by the structure of the
      input system? What do they say about the complexity of the computation itself (and not only the complexity
      of the basis)? These are questions at the heart of what we are aiming to discover, and the output of the
      threaded Groebner bases method @TO tgb@ returns this information in form of a {\bf lineage table}.
    Example
      QQ[x_1,x_0,x_3,x_5,x_4,x_2,MonomialOrder=>Lex]
      rnc = minors(2, matrix{{x_0..x_4},{x_1..x_5}})
      g = tgb(rnc,4)
    Text
      The lineage table is a hash table, whose values are Groebner basis elements, and whose kesy are the {\it lineages}.

      {\bf Definition.} A Lineage of a polynomial is a string tracing
      its history in the given Groebner basis computation.

      Lineages of length 1-- in the example above $0,\dots,9$-- are the original input polynomials.
      In the example above, these are the 10 minors.
    Example
      g#"1"
      g#"2"
    Text
      If the S-polynomial of g#"i" and g#"j" produces a non-zero remainder in Buchberger's algorithm,
      that remainder is added to the hashtable g with key (i-j), as in the following example.
    Example
      g#"(1-2)"
    Text
      As the algorithm continues, keys are concatenated, so that for example the remainder of S(0,S(1,2)) will
      have lineage (0-(1-2)), and so on.   For more complicated lineage examples, see @TO tgb@.

      Naturally, one can obtain
      a minimal basis or the reduced one as follows. In the output below, elements that are reduced
      are replaced by null, but their lineage keys are retained for informative purposes.
    Example
      minimalize g
      gRed = reduce g
    Text
      To get the Groebner basis in stanard M2 matrix format, use @TO cleanUp@:
    Example
      cleanUp gRed
    Text
      {\bf Nuts and Bolts}

      The main function,  @TO tgb@, uses  @TO Task@s to distribute the reduction of S-polynomials using a
      a current version of the Groenber basis.
      It can reduce and minimalize upon request, or print out  task scheduling information
      as it creates new tasks.
      The interesting part of the output may be the actual  lineages of the basis polynomials,
      in addition to the Groebner basis itself.
      Here is a verbose example when the Groebner basis is trivial.
    Example
      QQ[a..d]
      I=ideal( -c^3+a^2+b*d, a*b*c-1,a*b*c)
      T = tgb(I,2,Verbose=>true)
    Text
      In particular, the lineages of null values tell us what S-polynomials didn't reduce to zero until $1$ was found as
      a remainder.

    threaded Groebner bases
  Usage
    tgb(List, ZZ)
    tgb(Ideal, ZZ)
  Inputs
    L : List
      of polynomials
    I : Ideal
    n : ZZ
      number of threads to use to compute the Groebner basis
  Outputs
    : HashTable
      whose values are a Groebner basis for the ideal {\tt I} or the ideal generated by {\tt L},
      and keys are the lineages of the corresponging elements.
  Description
    Text
      Threaded Groebner basis uses  @TO Task@s to compute a Groebner basis of {\tt I} or {\tt ideal L}
      using $n$ threads.
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[x,y,z, MonomialOrder=>Lex];
      I = ideal {2*x + 10*y^2*z, 8*x^2*y + 10*x*y*z^3, 5*x*y^3*z^2 + 9*x*z^3, 9*x*y^3*z + 10*x*y^3};
      H = tgb(I,4)
    Text
      The keys of the hashtable are meaningful; for example, the polynomial with key
      {\tt ((0-2)-1)} in the hashtable {\tt tgb(L,n)} is the remainder upon division of the S-polynomial $(g, I_1)$,
      where $g$ is calculated from the S-pair $(I_0, I_2)$.
      For this reason, we say that the key communicates the "lineage" of the resulting polynomial.
      (See @TO ThreadedGB@.)

      Note that the keys in the hash table are strings, and the keys of input polynomials are 0..#L, as in the following example.
    Example
      H#"(0-1)"
    Text
      Some may be curious with respect to how tgb works.

      The starting basis $L$ (the input list {\tt L} or {\tt L=gens I})
      populate the 0..#L entries of a MutableHashTable $G$. The method creates all possible
      S-polynomials of $L$ and schedules their reduction with respect to $G$ as tasks.
      Throughout the computation, every nonzero remainder added to the basis is added to $G$
      with its lineage as the key. Each such remainder also triggers the creation of S-polynomials
      using it and every element in $G$ and scheduling the reduction thereof as additional tasks.
      The process is done when there are no remaining tasks.

      There is a way to track the tasks being created by turning on the option {\tt Verbose}.
    Example
      QQ[a..d];
      f0 = a*b-c^2;
      f1 = b*c-d^2;
      tgb({f0,f1},2,Verbose=>true)
    Text
      In the above example, the S-polynomial S(f0,f1) didn't reduce to zero hence the remainder was added to the
      output with key "(0-1)". The additional two S-polynomials reduced and the process ended.

    minimalize
    reduce
  Caveat
    Due to threads running in parallel, it can happen that there are redundant elements in the final
    Groebner basis. However these can be easily removed using @TO minimalize@, for example.

      This simple function just returns the Groebner basis computed with threaded GB

      The function works on any object that is of type HashTable, because it simply removes
      null values and returns the remaining values a entries of a matrix. However, the
      usage intended is when the hash table is the output of a run of @TO tgb@.
