     A package to construct various sorts of random ideals
Description
 Text
     This package can be used to make experiments, trying many ideals, perhaps
     over small fields. For example...what would you expect the regularities of
     "typical" monomial ideals with 10 generators of degree 3 in 6 variables to be?
     Try a bunch of examples -- it's fast.
     Here we do only 500 -- this takes about a second on a fast machine --
     but with a little patience, thousands can be done conveniently.
 Example
     setRandomSeed(currentTime())
     kk=ZZ/101;
     S=kk[vars(0..5)];
     time tally for n from 1 to 500 list regularity randomMonomialIdeal(10:3,S)
 Text
     How does this compare with the case of binomial ideals? or pure binomial ideals?
     We invite the reader to experiment, replacing "randomMonomialIdeal" above with
     "randomBinomialIdeal" or "randomPureBinomialIdeal", or taking larger numbers
     of examples. Click the link "Finding Extreme Examples" below to see
     some other, more elaborate ways to search.

	  P=randomShelling(R,m,k)

          n:ZZ
	       the number of vertices
	  R:Ring
	       a polynomial ring with a variable for each vertex
	  m:ZZ
	       the dimension of the facets

	       the number of facets (if omitted, the number will be {\tt n} choose {\tt m+1})
	      
     Outputs
          P:List
	       A list of lists of integers.  Each list of integers is a facet of the complex and the order is a shelling.  If called with a Ring {\tt R} instead of an integer {\tt n}, each facet is represented by a square-free monomial instead of a list.
     Description
          Text
              The function produces a list of facets of a random shellable simplicial complex.
	      The order of the facets is a shelling.
	  Text
	      The alogorithm works by choosing one of the previous facets at random, and replacing one of its vertices with a new vertex chosen at random.
	      If the choice meets the criteria of a shelling, that facet is added to list, otherwise it is discarded and the algorithm tries again.
	      The first facet is chosen uniformly at random.

	      The call randomShelling(n,m) produces a *complete* chain -- that is, a shelling
	      of the m-skeleton of the (n-1)-simplex, with the simplices listed in order,
	      so that any initial subsequence of length d gives a (random) shellable simplicial
	      complex with d facets. 
	      
	      The probability distribution for this random selection
	      is presumably not the uniform one; it would be nice to write a reversible
	      markov chain that could be used with the Metropolis algorithm to produce
	      the uniform distribution, as is done in randomSquareFreeStep, and the
	      randomSquareFreeMonomialIdeal codes
          Example
               P = randomShelling(6,3,10)
	       Q = randomShelling(6,3)
     Caveat
     	   No claim is made on the distribution of the random chain.

            This function randomly chooses a facet of size {\tt m+1} and checks whether the facet can be shellably added to the shelling. 
	    If it can be shellably added to the shelling, it is added to the shelling and the new shelling is returned. 
	    Otherwise, the process repeats up to 20 times.
          Text
	    This function can be used to randomly construct non-pure shellable complexes.  A new {\tt m}-simplex can only be
	    glued to previous simplices of dimension at least {\tt m}.  If all previous simplices are smaller, then the addition will fail.
          Example
            P={{1,2,3}}
	    P=randomAddition(6,2,P)
            P=randomAddition(6,1,P)
     Caveat
	  If the input is not a shellable simplicial complex, the new complex will not be shellable. The function does not check whether the input is shellable.

   Otherwise uses the Metropolis algorithm to produce a random walk on the space
   of square-free ideals. Note that there are a LOT of square-free ideals;
   these are the Dedekind numbers, and the sequence (with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 variables) 
   begins
   3,6,20,168,7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788.
   (see the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for more information).
   Given I in a polynomial ring S, we make a list
   ISocgens of the square-free minimal monomial generators of the socle of S/(squares+I)
   and a list of minimal generators Igens of I. A candidate "next" ideal J is formed as follows:
   We choose randomly from the 
   union of these lists; if a socle element is chosen, it's added to I; if
   a minimal generator is chosen, it's replaced by the square-free part of
   the maximal ideal times it.
   the chance of making the given move is then 1/(#ISocgens+#Igens), and
   the chance of making the move back would be the similar quantity for J,
   so we make the move or not depending on whether 
   random RR < (nJ+nSocJ)/(nI+nSocI) or not; here random RR is
   a random number in [0,1].

  "Finding Extreme Examples"
Headline
  Ways to use random ideals to search for (counter)-examples
Description
 Text
  A common use of Macaulay2 is to look for extreme or particularly
  interesting examples. Here are some examples of how this may be done.
   
  Supposing first that some space of examples is finite; for
  example, we might be interested in monomial ideals with a certain
  number of generators of a certain degree d. Suppose, to be concrete,
  that we want to compare the
  maximum degree of a first syzygy with the regularity of the ideal,
  and also with the maximum degree of the last syzygy. (To make the 
  comparison interesting, it seems reasonable to subtract i from the maximum
  degree of an i-th syzygy.)
 Text
  We may have no idea where to look for extreme examples, and it seems
  that examples with small numbers of variables and generators may not
  show the range of phenomena that actually occur. In large degree there
  may be too many examples to search systematically; so instead we may
  choose many examples at random, and hope to see a pattern. 
   
  Here is a simple example
  First we tally the projective dimensions of 500
  random square-free monomial ideals (what's the average?), then 
  looking how big the difference between the regularity of R/I and the
  "relation degree"-2 can be. It turns out this the differences are rather
  small, only 1 in a typical run of 5000. So one might look for ideals with
  a difference of 2, as in the following (in a real run, one would make
  the number of iterations much bigger; here we keep it small so
  that Macaulay2 doesn't take too long to build it's documentation files.)
 Example
  kk=ZZ/101
  S=kk[vars(0..5)]
  L=for n from 1 to 100 list res randomSquareFreeMonomialIdeal(10:3,S);
  tally apply(L, F -> length F)
  tally apply(L, F -> regularity F - ((max flatten degrees F_2) - 2))
  L=for n from 1 to 500 list res randomSquareFreeMonomialIdeal(10:3,S);
  scan(L, F -> if 1<(regularity F - (max flatten degrees F_2) + 2) then print F.dd_1)
 Text
  A typical problem might be to find how high the regularity of R/I can
  be when R has reasonably few variables, and the degrees of the generators of
  I are reasonably small; despite the wild examples of Mayr-Mayer, we don't
  know how to make examples with large regularity without letting the
  number of variables become large. The following program computes
  "rep" examples of random ideals with monomial and binomial generators,
  and prints any whose regularity exceeds the number "bound"

    
  looper = (rep,bound, L1, L2) -> (for i from 1 to rep do (
  if i % 1000 == 0 then << "." << flush;
  J := randomMonomialIdeal(L1,S) + randomBinomialIdeal(L2,S);
  m := regularity coker gens J;
  if m >= bound then << "reg " << m << " " << toString J << endl;))


  For example:
  kk=ZZ/2
  S=kk[a,b,c,d]
  looper(30000,10,{4},{4,4}) -- finds examples with on monomial of degree 4
  and 2 binomials of degree 4. The largest largest regularity it has found
  (and the largest I know for an ideal in 4 variables of degree 4) is 14.
  Here is an example it found:
  ideal(a*b^3,a^4+b^4,b*c^3+a*d^3)
   
  Similarly:
  
  looper(30000,10,{4,4},{4}) -- looks for examples with
  2 monomials and 1 binomial of degree 4. Suggestively, the
  largest regularity it found was also 14:
  betti res ideal(c^4,b^4,a^3*c+b*d^3) -- reg 14
 Text   
  A more sophisticated and difficult situation arises when the space
  of examples is not necessarily finite (except over a finite field) but
  is a unirational
  variety (such as the space of ideals generated by (at most) a certain
  number of forms of certain given degrees, or the space of smooth curves
  of genus g for some g <= 14) one may be able to do a search for random
  examples, taking a rational parametrization of the space of examples
  and plugging in random inputs.
   
  If the "interesting" examples live in
  a subvariety whose codimension is small, then, working over a small field
  (say 2,3, or 5 elements) one might hope to see elements of the subvariety
  "not too rarely". This principle has been used to good effect for example
  by (Caviglia and Decker-Schreyer, ****--Schreyer).

    Creates a toric edge ideal from a random graph with n vertices and t edges.
   Usage
    (I, G) = randomToricEdgeIdeal(n,t)
   Inputs
    n:ZZ
     number of vertices
    t:ZZ
     number of edges
   Outputs
    I:Ideal
     a random toric edge ideal
    G:Graph
     the graph underlying I
   Description
    Text
     The toric edge ideal of a graph G is the kernel of the map from the polynomial ring k[edges(G)] to the polynomial ring k[vertices G] taking an x_e to y_i*y_j, where e = (i,j).
     This method returns the toric edge ideal {\tt I} of a random graph {\tt G} which has n vertices and t edges.  {\tt I} is the kernel of the homomorphism from QQ[x_1..x_n] to QQ/101[e_1..e_t] which sends each vertex in the graph {\tt G} to the product of its endpoints.
    Example
     randomToricEdgeIdeal(4,5)
