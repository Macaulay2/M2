     	create chemical reaction networks and corresponding steady-state and conservation equations
    Description
     	Text
	    The @EM "ReactionNetworks" @ package provides functions for creating the
	    steady-state and conservation equations corresponding to a given
            reaction network. Included are some basic building-block motifs,
            which can be joined together to create specific reaction network.
	    Examples are provided illustrating elimination and degeneration with
	    removal of a species or a reaction and the corresponding effect
            on the solutions of the system.

	    {\bf Examples}

	        The following example demonstrates how to compute
		the degree and dimension of the ideal cut out
		by the steady-state and conservation equations.
	Example
	    N = reactionNetwork "A <--> 2B, A + C <--> D, B + E --> A + C, D --> B+E"
	    R = createRing(N, QQ)
    	Text
	    After creating the reaction network and the corresponding ring,
	    we create the steady state equations and substitute random values
	    for the reaction rates; this will allows us to compute the degree
	    of the ideal.
	Example
	    SS = flatten entries steadyStateEquations N
	    K = toList(apply(0..length N.ReactionRates-1, i-> random(QQ)))
	    Rr = toList(apply(0..length N.ReactionRates-1, i->
		    value(N.ReactionRates#i)))
	    P = toList(apply(0..length Rr-1, i-> Rr#i=>sub(K#i,R)))
	    F' = toList apply(0..length SS-1, i-> sub(SS#i,P))
	Text
	    Next, we create the conservation equations and assume there is no
	    translation, i.e., the intial conditions are all zero.
	Example
	    C = conservationEquations N
	    L = {0,0,0,0,0}
	    Iv = toList(apply(0..length N.InitialValues-1, i->
		    value(N.InitialValues#i)))
	    S = toList(apply(0..length Iv-1, i-> Iv#i=>L#i))
	    F'' = toList apply(0..length C-1, i-> sub(C#i,S))
	Text
	    Finally, we join the two sets of equations and create an ideal. Thus,
	    the degree and dimension can be computed.
	Example
	    F = join(F',F'')
	    I = ideal F
	    degree I
	    dim I
