    Description
        Text
            Given a ring $R$ with canonical module $\omega$, this function computes the image of $F^e_* \omega \to \omega$ for $e >> 0$.  
	    This image is sometimes called the {\it HSLG module} (named for Hartshorne-Speiser, Lyubeznik, and Gabber), and it roughly tells us where a ring is non-$F$-injective.
            It can also be used to compute the maximal $F$-pure sub-Cartier module of a given rank-1 Cartier module (represented as an ideal).
            The name of the function is based on this interpretation.

            Specifically, this function returns a sequence {\tt (FPMod, canMod, frobTrace, count)}, where {\tt canMod} is a canonical module of the ring (expressed as an ideal), {\tt FPMod} is the HSLG module, given as a submodule of {\tt canMod}, {\tt frobTrace} is a list of elements of the ambient polynomial ring representing the trace of Frobenius on the canonical module, and {\tt count} is the number of times the trace of Frobenius was computed before the image stabilized, sometimes called the {\it HSLG number} of the canonical module as a Cartier module.
        Example
            R = ZZ/7[x,y,z]/(x^5 + y^5 + z^5);
            (FPMod, canMod, frobTrace, count) = FPureModule(R);
            canMod --the ambient canonical module
            FPMod --the F-pure submodule of the canonical module
            frobTrace --the element representing trace of Frobenius
            count --how many times it took until the image stabilized
        Text
            Sometimes it is convenient to specify the ambient canonical module across multiple calls of {\tt FPureModule}.  
	    This can be done by using the option {\tt CanonicalIdeal}.
            One can also pass it something other than the canonical module as well (for example, a submodule of the canonical module).

            Likewise, one can use the {\tt GeneratorList} option to specify the dual Frobenius action on the canonical module (or ideal playing the role of the canonical module).

            In the following example, the non-$F$-pure ideal of a $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein ring is computed by hijacking this functionality.
        Example
            T = ZZ/7[a,b];
            S = ZZ/7[x,y,z,w];
            f = map(T, S, {a^3, a^2*b, a*b^2, b^3});
            R = S/(ker f);
            J = ideal 1_R;
            u = QGorensteinGenerator(1, R);
            FPureModule(CanonicalIdeal => J, GeneratorList => {u})
        Text
            Additionally, one can specify a pair ($R$, $f^{ t}$), as long as $t$ is a rational number with a denominator prime to the characteristic of the ring.
        Example
            R = ZZ/7[x,y];
            M = FPureModule(5/6, y^2 - x^3);
            M#1 -- the canonical module
            M#0 -- the F-pure submodule
            N = FPureModule(9/10, y^2 - x^3);
            N#0 -- the F-pure submodule
        Text
            Finally, one can specify a pair ($R$, $f_1^{t_1}\cdots f_n^{t_n}$), even when $R$ is not regular (although $R$ is required to be $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein, with index not divisible by the characteristic).
        Example
            R = ZZ/3[x,y,z]/(x^2 - y*z);
            f = y;
            g = z;
            FPureModule({1/2, 1/2, 1/2}, {y, z, y + z})

    Description
        Text
            This command computes the maximal $F$-pure Cartier submodule of an ideal $J$ under the dual-$e$-iterated Frobenius induced by ${\tt f_1^{t_1}\ldots f_n^{t_n}}$.
        
            The function returns a sequence, where the first entry is the descended ideal, and the second entry is the number of times {\tt frobeniusRoot} was applied (i.e., the HSL number).
        Example
            R = ZZ/7[x,y,z];
            f = y^2 - x^3;
            descendIdeal(1, {5}, {f}, ideal 1_R) --this computes the non-F-pure ideal of (R, f^{5/6})
            descendIdeal(2, {41}, {f}, ideal 1_R) --this computes the non-F-pure ideal of (R, f^{41/48})
        Text
            The same two examples could also be accomplished via calls of {\tt FPureModule}, as illustrated below; however, the {\tt descendIdeal} construction gives the user more direct control.
        Example
            first FPureModule(5/6, f, CanonicalIdeal => ideal 1_R, GeneratorList => {1_R})
            first FPureModule(41/48, f, CanonicalIdeal => ideal 1_R, GeneratorList => {1_R})

    Description
        Text
            This function determines whether a ring of finite type over a finite prime field is $F$-injective.
	    Over a more general field, it checks the $F$-injectivity of the relative Frobenius.
            We begin with an example of an $F$-injective ring that is not $F$-pure (taken from the work of Anurag Singh on deformation of $F$-regularity).
        Example
             S = ZZ/3[a,b,c,d,t];
             M = matrix{{a^2 + t^4, b, d}, {c, a^2, b^3-d}};
             I = minors(2, M);
             R = S/I;
             isFInjective(R)
             isFPure(R)
        Text
            Next, let us form the cone over $\mathbb{P}^1 \times  E$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve.
	    We begin with a supersingular elliptic curve.
	    This should be $F$-injective if and only if it is $F$-pure.
        Example
            S = ZZ/3[xs, ys, zs, xt, yt, zt];
            EP1 = ZZ/3[x,y,z,s,t]/(x^3 + y^2*z - x*z^2); --supersingular elliptic curve
            f = map(EP1, S, {x*s, y*s, z*s, x*t, y*t, z*t});
            R = S/(ker f);
            isFInjective(R)
            isFPure(R)
        Text
            Now we do a similar computation, this time with an ordinary elliptic curve.
        Example
            S = ZZ/3[xs, ys, zs, xt, yt, zt];
            EP1 = ZZ/3[x,y,z,s,t]/(y^2*z - x^3 + x*y*z); --ordinary elliptic curve
            f = map(EP1, S, {x*s, y*s, z*s, x*t, y*t, z*t});
            R = S/(ker f);
            isFInjective(R)
            isFPure(R)
        Text
            If {\tt CanonicalStrategy} is set to {\tt Katzman} (its default behavior), then the Frobenius action on the top local cohomology (bottom Ext) is computed via the method of Katzman.
	    If it is set to anything else, it is simply brute forced in {\it Macaulay2} using the functoriality of Ext.
	    The {\tt Katzman} strategy is typically much faster.
        Example
            R = ZZ/5[x,y,z]/(y^2*z + x*y*z-x^3)
            time isFInjective(R)
            time isFInjective(R, CanonicalStrategy => null)
        Text
            If the option {\tt IsLocal} (default value {\tt false}) is set to {\tt true}, {\tt isFInjective} will only check $F$-injectivity at the origin.
	    Otherwise, it will check $F$-injectivity globally.
	    Note that checking $F$-injectivity at the origin can be slower than checking it globally.
	    Consider the following example of a non-$F$-injective ring.
        Example
            R = ZZ/7[x,y,z]/((x-1)^5 + (y+1)^5 + z^5);
            time isFInjective(R)
            time isFInjective(R, IsLocal => true)
        Text
            If the option {\tt AssumeCM} (default value {\tt false}) is set to {\tt true}, then {\tt isFInjective} only checks the Frobenius action on top cohomology (which is typically much faster). Note that it can give an incorrect answer if the non-injective Frobenius occurs in a lower degree.  Consider the example of the cone over a supersingular elliptic curve times $\mathbb{P}^1$.
        Example
            S = ZZ/3[xs, ys, zs, xt, yt, zt];
            EP1 = ZZ/3[x,y,z,s,t]/(x^3 + y^2*z - x*z^2);
            f = map(EP1, S, {x*s, y*s, z*s, x*t, y*t, z*t});
            R = S/(ker f);
            time isFInjective(R)
            time isFInjective(R, AssumeCM => true)
        Text
            If the option {\tt AssumedReduced} is set to {\tt true} (its default behavior), then the bottom local cohomology is avoided (this means the Frobenius action on the top potentially nonzero Ext is not computed).
        Text
            If the option {\tt AssumeNormal} (default value {\tt false}) is set to {\tt true}, then the bottom two local cohomology modules (or, rather, their duals) need not be computed.
