	:Sequence
	    consisting of the stable (ascended) ideal and the number of steps it took before the ascent of the ideal stabilized (when the option {\tt AscentCount} is set to {\tt true})
    Description
        Text
	    Let $J$ be an ideal in a polynomial ring $S$ of characteristic $p>0$.
	    An element $h$ of $S$ determines a $p^{-e}$-linear map $\phi: S \to\ S$, obtained by premultiplying the $e^{th}$ Frobenius trace on $S$ by $h$. 
            The function {\tt ascendIdeal} finds the smallest $\phi$-stable ideal of $S$ containing $J$, which is the stable value of the ascending chain $J\subseteq J + \phi(J)\subseteq J + \phi(J) + \phi^2(J)\subseteq \cdots$.

            If $J$ is not an ideal of a polynomial ring, but of a quotient of a polynomial ring, {\tt ascendIdeal} will do the computation with the $e^{th}$ Frobenius trace in the ambient polynomial ring, but will do the comparison, to see if stabilization has occured, inside the quotient ring.
        Example
            S = ZZ/5[x,y,z];
            g = x^4 + y^4 + z^4;
            h = g^4;
            R = S/(g);
            ascendIdeal(1, h, ideal y^3)
            ascendIdeal(1, h, ideal (sub(y, S))^3) 
        Text
            The alternate ways to call the function allow the function to behave more efficiently. 
	    Indeed, frequently the polynomial passed is a power, $h^a$.  
	    If $a$ is large, it is more efficient not to compute $h^a$, but instead, to keep the exponent small by only raising $h$ to the minimal power needed to do the computation at that time.
        Example
            S = ZZ/5[x,y,z];
            g = x^4 + y^4 + z^4;
            R = S/(g);
            ascendIdeal(1, 4, g, ideal y^3)
            ascendIdeal(1, 4, g, ideal (sub(y, S))^3)
        Text
            More generally, if $h$ is a product of powers, $h = h_1^{a_1}\ldots h_n^{a_n}$, then it is more efficient to pass {\tt ascendIdeal} the lists {\tt expList = \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}} and {\tt hList = \{h_1,\ldots,h_n\}} of exponents and bases.

            By default (when {\tt AscentCount => false}), {\tt ascendIdeal} just returns the stable (ascended) ideal.  
	    If, instead, {\tt AscentCount} is set to {\tt true}, then {\tt ascendIdeal} returns a sequence whose first entry is the stable ideal, and the second is the number of steps it took for the ascending chain to stabilize and reach that ideal.
        Example
            R = ZZ/5[x,y,z];
            J = ideal(x^12, y^15, z^21);
            f = y^2 + x^3 - z^5;
            ascendIdeal(1, f^4, J)
            ascendIdeal(1, f^4, J, AscentCount => true)
        Text
            The option {\tt FrobeniusRootStrategy} is passed to internal @TO frobeniusRoot@ calls.

            This method is described in M. Katzman's {\it Parameter-test-ideals of Cohenâ€“Macaulay rings} (Compositio Mathematica 144 (4), 933-948), under the name "star-closure".
            It is a key tool in computing test ideals and test modules.

    Description
        Text
            Given an $n\times n$ matrix $U$ and a submodule $M$ of a free module $R^n$, {\tt ascendModule} finds the smallest submodule $V$ of $R^n$ containing $M$ and which satisfies $U^{1 + p + \cdots + p^{e-1}} V\subseteq V^{[p^e]}$.
        Example
            R = ZZ/2[a,b,c,d];
            A = matrix {{b*c, a, 0}, {a^2* d, d^2 , c + d}};

            For ease of use, instead of passing the module $M$, one can instead pass a matrix $A$ whose image is $M$, and {\tt ascendModule} will return a matrix whose image is $V$.

    Description
        Text
            In a polynomial ring $R = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ with cofficients in a field of positive characteristic $p$, the $p^e$-th Frobenius root $I^{[1/p^e]}$ of an ideal $I$ is the smallest ideal $J$ such that $I\subseteq J^{[p^e]}$ ({\tt = frobeniusPower(p^e, J)}).
            Similarly, if $M$ is a submodule of $R^k$, the $p^e$-th Frobenius root of $M$, denoted $M^{[1/p^e]}$, is the smallest submodule $V$ of $R^k$ such that $M\subseteq V^{[p^e]}$.
	    The function {\tt frobeniusRoot} computes such ideals and submodules.

            There are many ways to call {\tt frobeniusRoot}. The simplest way is to call {\tt frobeniusRoot(e, I)}, which computes $I^{[1/p^e]}$.
        Example
            R = ZZ/5[x,y,z];
            I = ideal(x^50*z^95, y^100 + z^27);
            frobeniusRoot(2, I)
        Text
            The function {\tt frobeniusRoot} works over arbitrary finite fields.
        Example
            p = 3;
            R = GF(p^2)[x,y,z];
            I = ideal(a^(2*p)*x^p + y*z^p + x^p*y^p);
            frobeniusRoot(1, I)
        Text
            In the following example, for a submodule $M$ of $R^2$, {\tt frobeniusRoot(1, M)} computes the smallest submodule $V$ of $R^2$ such that $M \subseteq V^{[2]}$.  
        Example
            R = ZZ/2[a,b,c,d];
            A = matrix {{a^4  + a*b*c^2  + a*b*c*d, a^2* b}, {a^2*c*d^3 , a^3* c*d + a^3 *d^2  + b*c*d^3}};
	    M = image A;
            frobeniusRoot(1, M)
        Text
	    For ease of use, one can also simply pass a matrix $A$ whose image is $M$, and {\tt frobeniusRoot(1, A)} returns a matrix whose image is $V$.
        Example    
	    frobeniusRoot(1, A)
        Text
            Often, one wants to compute a Frobenius root of some product of powers of ideals, $I_1^{a_1}\cdots I_n^{a_n}$. This is best accomplished by calling {\tt frobeniusRoot(e, \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}, \{I_1,\ldots,I_n\})}.
        Example
            R =  ZZ/5[x,y,z];
            I1 = ideal(x^10, y^10, z^10);
            I2 = ideal(x^20*y^100, x + z^100);
            I3 = ideal(x^50*y^50*z^50);
            time J1 = frobeniusRoot(1, {8, 10, 12}, {I1, I2, I3});
            time J2 = frobeniusRoot(1, I1^8*I2^10*I3^12);
	    J1 == J2
        Text
            For legacy reasons, the last ideal in the list can be specified separately, using {\tt frobeniusRoot(e, \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}, \{I_1,\ldots,I_n\}, I)}. The last ideal, {\tt I}, is just raised to the first power.
        Text
            The following are additional ways of calling {\tt frobeniusRoot}:

	    $\bullet$ {\tt frobeniusRoot(e, m, I)} computes the $p^e$-th Frobenius root of the ideal $I^m$.

	    $\bullet$ {\tt frobeniusRoot(e, a, f)} computes the $p^e$-th Frobenius root of the principal ideal ($f^{ a}$).

	    $\bullet$ {\tt frobeniusRoot(e, a, f, I)} computes the $p^e$-th Frobenius root of the product $f^{ a}I$.
        Text
            There are two valid inputs for the option {\tt FrobeniusRootStrategy}, namely {\tt Substitution} and {\tt MonomialBasis}.  In the computation of the $p^e$-th Frobenius root of an ideal $I$, each generator $f$ of $I$ is written in the form $f = \sum a_i^{p^e} m_i$, where each $m_i$ is a monomial whose exponents are less than $p^e$; then the collection of all the $a_i$, obtained for all generators of $I$, generates the Frobenius root $I^{[1/p^e]}$. {\tt Substitution} and {\tt MonomialBasis} use different methods for gathering these $a_i$, and sometimes one method is faster than the other.
