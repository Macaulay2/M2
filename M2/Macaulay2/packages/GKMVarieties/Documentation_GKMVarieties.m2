		computations with GKM varieties and moment graphs
	Description
		Text
			A GKM variety is a variety $X$, often assumed to be smooth and complete, with an 
			action of an algebraic torus $T$ satisfying the following conditions:
			(i) $X$ is equivariantly formal with respect to the the action of $T$,
			(ii) $X$ has finitely many $T$-fixed points, and (iii) $X$ has finitely
			many one-dimensional $T$-orbits.  The data of the zero and one dimensional
			$T$-orbits of $X$ define the moment graph of $X$, with which one can carry out
			$T$-equivariant cohomology and $T$-equivariant $K$-theory computations via
			the method of localization.
			This package provides methods for these computations in Macaulay2.

		"Example: generalized flag varieties"
	Description
		Text
			Let $G$ be a reductive complex Lie group and $P$ a 
			parabolic subgroup containing a maximal torus $T$.  The generalized flag variety $G/P$ is a GKM variety 
			with the action of $T$.  This package allows users to create a generalized flag variety for classical Lie types 
			($A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$) as a @TO "GKMVariety"@ with conventions explicitly laid out as follows.

		Text
			For type $A_{n-1}$, the group $G$ is $GL_{n}$, and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$, the group of invertible diagonal matrices.

		Text
			For type $B_n$, the group $G$ is $SO_{2n+1}$, where we set the standard symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbb C^{2n+1}$ 
			to be is given by the matrix
			$$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_n & 0 \\ I_n & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
			and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1}, 1)$.

		Text
			For type $C_n$, the group $G$ is $Sp_{2n}$, where we set the standard alternating bilinear form on 
			$\mathbb C^{2n}$ to be given by the matrix
			$$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -I_n \\ I_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
			and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1})$.

		Text
			For type $D_n$, the group $G$ is $SO_{2n}$, where we set the standard symmetric bilinear form on 
			$\mathbb C^{2n}$ to be given by the matrix
			$$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_n \\ I_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
			and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1} \ldots, t_n^{-1})$.

		Text
			In all the cases, the standard action of $(\mathbb C^*)^m$ on $\mathbb C^m$ is defined by $(t_1, \ldots, t_m) \cdot (x_1, \ldots, x_m) = (t_1^{-1}x_1, \ldots, t_m^{-1}x_m)$.  

		Text
			Let $\{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}$ be a set of fundamental weights, which for classical Lie types are explicitly set to be 
			as follows:

			($A_{n-1}$): $\{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}= \{e_1, e_1+e_2, \ldots , e_1+e_2+\cdots+e_{n-1}\}$

			($B_n$): $\{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}= \{e_1, e_1+e_2, \ldots , e_1+\cdots+e_{n-1}, (1/2)(e_1+\cdots e_n)\}$

			($C_n$): $\{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}= \{e_1, e_1+e_2, \ldots , e_1+\cdots+e_{n-1}, e_1 + \cdots +e_n\}$

			($D_n$): $\{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}= \{e_1, e_1+e_2, \ldots , e_1+\cdots+e_{n-2}, (1/2)(e_1+\cdots+e_{n-2} +e_{n-1}- e_{n}), (1/2)(e_1+\cdots+e_{n-2}+e_{n-1}+e_n)\}$

		Text
			For a sequence $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in \mathbb N^n$ of nonnegative integers, 
			let $I = \{i \mid a_i \neq 0\}$ and $P_I$ the corresponding parabolic subgroup of $G$.
			Then the generalized flag variety $G/P_I$ is embedded in the irreducible representation of $G$ 
			with the highest weight $a_1w_1 + \cdots a_nw_n$.
			These generalized flag varieties can be created as a @TO "GKMVariety"@ using the method 
			@TO generalizedFlagVariety@.  For instance, the Grassmannian $Gr(2,4)$ of
			2-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^4$, embedded in $\mathbb P^5$ by the usual Plucker embedding, 
			can be created as follows.

		Example
			Gr24 = generalizedFlagVariety("A",3,{2})
			peek Gr24

		Text
			The @TO MomentGraph@ of $Gr(2,4)$ is the 1-skeleton of the hypersimplex $\Delta(2,4)$, a.k.a. the octahedron.

		Example
			G = momentGraph Gr24
			underlyingGraph G

		Text
			The line bundle $O(1)$ on $Gr(2,4)$, corresponding to its Plucker embedding, can be accessed by @TO (ampleKClass, GKMVariety)@.
			The method @TO (euler, KClass)@ computes its Lefschetz trace (a.k.a. equivariant Euler characteristic),
			which in this case is the Laurent polynomial in the character ring of the torus $T$ 
			whose terms correspond to be weights of the second exterior power of the standard representation of $GL_4$.

		Example
			O1 = ampleKClass Gr24 --the O(1) bundle on Gr24 via its Plucker embedding
			euler O1

		Text
			If $Gr(2,4)$ is embedded differently, say by the line bundle $O(2)$ instead, the Lefschetz trace changes 
			accordingly, and its coefficients record the multiplicities of the associated weight spaces in the second
			symmetric power of the second exterior power of the standard representation of $GL_4$.

		Example
			euler (O1^2)

		Text
			The Schubert decomposition of $Gr(2,4)$, and more generally the Bruhat decomposition of $G/P$, can be accessed 
			by the method @TO (bruhatOrder, GKMVariety)@, which outputs the poset of the Bruhat order.  Moreover, the Schubert
			varieties can be created via the method @TO generalizedSchubertVariety@.

		Example
			P1 =  bruhatOrder Gr24
			Sch = generalizedSchubertVariety(Gr24,{set{1,2}})
			P2 = bruhatOrder Sch
			--{P1,P2}/displayPoset --to view the posets in pdf

		Text
			The "forgetful" map from the complete flag variety $Fl(4)$ to $Gr(2,4)$, 
			given by forgetting the subpsaces in the complete flag except for the 2-dimensional one, can be created as 
			a @TO EquivariantMap@ by the method @TO flagMap@.

		Example
			Fl4 = generalizedFlagVariety("A",3,{1,2,3},Gr24.characterRing) --Fl(4) with the torus having the same character ring as Gr24
			f = flagMap(Fl4,Gr24)
			Fl4 === f.source and Gr24 === f.target

		Text
			As $Fl(4)$ is a $BiProj$ of vector bundles on $Gr(2,4)$, the (derived) pushforward of the structure sheaf 
			of $Fl(4)$ is the structure sheaf of $Gr(2,4)$ since the higher direct images vanish under the forgetful map.

		Example
			(trivialKClass Gr24) === (pushforward f)(trivialKClass Fl4)

		Text
			For type $C$, the following example features the isotropic Grassmannian $SpGr(2,6)$ consisting of 
			2-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^6$ that are isotropic with respect to the standard alternating form.
			The vertices of its moment graph can be considered as the vertices of the cuboctahedron.

		Example
			SpGr26 = generalizedFlagVariety("C",3,{2})
			peek SpGr26
			momentGraph SpGr26

		Text
			The second fundamental representation of $Sp_{6}$ is 14-dimensional with 12 extremal weights.

		Example
			euler ampleKClass SpGr26

		Text
			For type $B$, the following example features the isotropic Grassmannian $SOGr(2,5)$ consisting of
			3-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^5$ that are isotropic with respect to the standard symmetric form.
			Its moment graph is the a complete graph on 4 vertices.
			Note that Spin groups and their representations are not implemented, so for the type $B_n$ the coefficient
			$a_n$ need be a multiple of 2.

		Example
			SOGr25 = generalizedFlagVariety("B",2,{2,2}) --inputing {2} instead of {2,2} results in error: spin groups not implemented yet
			peek SOGr25
			euler ampleKClass SOGr25

		Text
			For type $D$, the following example features the isotropic Grassmannian $SOGr(3,8)$ consisting of
			3-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^8$ that are isotropic with respect to the standard symmetric form.

		Example
			SOGr38 = generalizedFlagVariety("D",4,{3,4})
			SOGr38.points

		Text
			Similarly as in type $B$, Spin groups are not implemented, so the two connected components of 
			$SOGr(4,8)$ need be separatedly created in the following way.

		Example
			SOGr48odd = generalizedFlagVariety("D",4,{3,3})
			SOGr48odd.points
			SOGr48even = generalizedFlagVariety("D",4,{4,4})
			SOGr48even.points

	Caveat
		Does not check for low-dimensional isogeneis.  For instance, always use type $D_n$ with $n\geq 4$ to be safe.

		"Example: smooth toric varieties"
	Description
		Text
			A toric variety is an integral variety containing an open dense algebraic torus. If the 
			toric variety is smooth (or simplicial) it is naturally a GKM variety:
			Let $X$ be a smooth toric variety 
			and $U$ be an affine chart whose associated character lattice is generated by elements of
			weights $a_1,\dots, a_m$. Then $(\mathbb C^*)^n$ acts on $U$ by 
			$t \cdot (x_1,\dots, x_n) = (t^{-a_1}x_1,\dots, t^{-a_n}x_n)$.
			We caution that this package uses the outer normals instead of inner normals.
			
		Text	
			The method @TO "normalToricVariety"@ from the package @TO "NormalToricVarieties"@ allows the 
			user to construct smooth toric varieties. To convert it to a GKM variety we use the method
			@TO "makeGKMVariety"@. Here is an example with $X = Bl_p\mathbb P^2$, the blow-up of $\mathbb P^2$ at a point,
			which is also the first Hirzebruch surface.
		Example
			FF1 = hirzebruchSurface 1;
			X = makeGKMVariety FF1;
			peek FF1
			peek X

   		Text
			If a GKM variety $X$ was originally constructed from @TO "normalToricVariety"@ we can convert it
			back to a toric variety.
		Example
			Y = normalToricVariety(X); -- X defined in the previous example above
			Y === FF1
		Text
			Continuing this example, the following shows how to convert a torus-invariant divisor constructed using
			@TO ToricDivisor@ to a @TO KClass@.

		Example
			antiK = - toricDivisor(FF1) -- the anti-canonical class on FF1
			TantiK = makeKClass(X,antiK)
			isWellDefined TantiK

		Text
			Since the toric variety $X = Bl_p\mathbb P^2$ is Gorenstein Fano, 
			with its anticanonical embedding in $\mathbb P^8$, the equivariant Euler characteristic of
			the anticanonical divisor is the sum of the characters of the sections of the associated line bundle.

		Example
			euler TantiK

		Text
			We caution the following difference in convention:
			Projective $n$-space $\mathbb P^n$ as a @TO NormalToricVariety@ constructed using @TO "toricProjectiveSpace"@
			is acted upon by an $n$-dimensional torus. However, as a @TO GKMVariety@
			constructed using @TO "projectiveSpace"@, it is acted upon by an $(n+1)$-dimensional torus.
		Example
			X = makeGKMVariety toricProjectiveSpace 2; -- the torus is C^2
	   		Y = projectiveSpace 2; -- the torus is C^3
			peek X
			peek Y
