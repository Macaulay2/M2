    PHCpack 
  Headline
    a package for Polynomial Homotopy Continuation
  Description
    Text
      This package provides an interface to the software {\tt PHCpack}, a
      general-purpose polynomial system solver that uses homotopy continuation.
      The main method is a numerical blackbox solver, 
      implemented for Laurent systems.  The package also provides a fast mixed 
      volume computation, the ability to filter solutions, extract real 
      solutions, or track solution paths defined by a polynomial homotopy.
      For positive dimensional solution sets, we can
      compute a numerical irreducible decomposition.
      
      The software {\tt PHCpack} itself is available at
      @HREF"http://www.math.uic.edu/~jan/download.html"@.
      This site provides source code and its executable version {\tt phc}.
      To use the methods from this package, the user must have the executable 
      program {\tt phc} available, preferably in the execution path. 
      The functions in this package call the {\tt phc} executable,
      behind the scenes, with appropriate input options, and save 
      intermediate output to temporary files.
      For convenience, the file names are displayed, and the commands that 
      are invoked are documented under "Consequences" for each function.
      
      Below is a simple example using the most popular function, 
      the numerical blackbox solver.
      
    Example     
      R = CC[x,y,z]
      system = {y-x^2,z-x^3,x+y+z-1}
      solns = solveSystem(system)
      numSolns = #solns
      solns/print

    Text
      We see that there are three solutions to the above system. 
      Each solution is of type @TO Point@ and contains diagnostic information 
      about the quality of the solution.    
    
    Example
      oneSoln = solns_0
      peek oneSoln
    Text 
         
      The value of {\tt LastT} is the end value of the continuation parameter:
      if it equals 1, then the solver reached the end of the path properly.
  Caveat
    {\bf 1.} If you are having trouble installing the package, 
    check whether the path to your PHCpack executable was set correctly. 
    You can check this by typing the following command:
	       
	       options PHCpack 
	       
    If it is wrong, you can update it by putting the absolute path 
    into the {\tt init-PHCpack.m2} file,
    For example, if the executable {\tt phc} is located in C:/cygwin/PHC,
    then the line inside the {\tt init-PHCpack.m2} file will look like this: 
	       
	        "path" => "C:/cygwin/PHC/" .
	       
    Alternately, the path could be set when loading the package 
    using the following command:
     	       
      loadPackage ("PHCpack", 
      Configuration=>{"path"=>"C:/cygwin/PHC/","PHCexe"=>"./phc"}) 

    {\bf 2.} If the package SimpleDoc is not found when 
    installing {\tt PHCpack.m2}, see questions and answers 6, 7, and 8 
    on the Macaulay2 web site.

    {\bf 3.} The current version 1.8 of PHCpack.m2 was developed with version 
    1.9 of Macaulay2 and with version 2.4.17 of phc.

  Description
    Text
      The version number and release date of the executable phc
      are important for consistency between the methods in this
      package and preparing the input batch files for the executable phc.

      A successful run of this method verifies whether the location
      of the executable phc is in the execution path.

  Description
    Text
      Optional argument for {\tt cascade} 
      and {\tt numericalIrreducibleDecomposition}.
      These methods search for positive dimensional components starting 
      at the {\tt StartDimension} 
      and then considering all the subsequent lower dimensions. 
      
      The default value for {\tt StartDimension} is the number of variables 
      in the system minus one.
      
      If the user has a good idea about the top dimension, using a smaller
      {\tt StartDimension} than the default will reduce the computational time.

  Description
    Text
      To compute generic points of a k-dimensional solution set of a
      polynomial system, we add k random linear equations to the system.
      
    Example
      R = CC[x,y,z];
      f = { x^2 - y, x^3 - z };
      fe1 = constructEmbedding(f,1);
      toString fe1

    Text
      Note that the ring of the original system is extended with
      k slack variables.  Solutions of the embedded system with
      zero values for the slack variables are candidate generic points.

      If the input system is overdetermined (there are more equations
      than unknowns), then as many surplus variables are introduced as
      the difference between the number of equations and the number of
      variables.  Surplus variables start with ss.
      
    Example
      R = CC[x,y,z];
      f = { x^2-y, x^3-z, x*y-z, x*z-y^2 };
      fe1 = constructEmbedding(f,1);
      toString fe1
    Text
    
      In the example above, the system f has four equations in three unknowns,
      constructEmbedding adds one surplus variable and one slack variable.
      Only solutions with zero values for the surplus variable are relevant.

  Description
    Text
      The mixed volume of a polynomial system $S:=\{f_1,\dots,f_n\}$ 
      is defined as follows:
      Let $P_1,\dots,P_n$ be the Newton polytopes 
      of $f_1,\dots,f_n$, i.e., $P_i$ is the convex hull of the exponents 
      of the monomials in the support of $f_i$. 
      The mixed volume of $S$ is 
      $$ \sum_{1\leq h\leq n} 
      \sum_{1\leq i_1\dots\leq i_h\leq n} (-1)^{n-h}V_n(P_{i_1}+\dots+P_{i_h}),
      $$
      where $V_n$ denotes the $n$-dimensional Euclidean volume.
      
      Bernstein's theorem (D. N. Bernstein,{\em  The number of roots of 
      a system of equations}, Functional. Anal. Appl 9 (1975), no. 3, 183-185), 
      a generalization of the classical Bezout's theorem, shows that for 
      a zero-dimensional system, 
      the mixed volume provides an upper bound on the number of complex 
      isolated roots. 
      If the coefficients of the system are sufficiently generic, 
      the mixed volume is a sharp bound.
       
    Example
      R = CC[x,y];
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};
      I=ideal f;
      dim I
      degree I
      m = mixedVolume(f) -- counts the number of complex roots in the torus (without zero components)

  Description
    Text
      By default, all computations occur in hardward double precision.
      While this precision could be large enough to obtain accurate
      results, for larger problems, one may need to increase the
      precision to double double or to quad double precision.
      
      Setting the value of computingPrecision to 2 changes the
      precision in the path trackers to double double.

      Setting the value of computingPrecision to 4 changes the
      precision in the path trackers to quad double.

      To compensate for the cost overhead of the higher precision,
      it is useful to run the multithreaded versions of the path
      trackers, see the option numThreads.

      fSols/print
      zeroSols = zeroFilter(fSols,0,1.0e-10);
      zeroSols/print
    Text
      Good values for the tolerance are relative to the accuracy
      and the condition number of the solution.

    Text
      Suppose we want numerical approximations of all complex isolated

    Example
      R = CC[x,y,z]
      S = {x+y+z-1, x^2+y^2, x+y-z-3}
    Text
      We call {\tt PHCpack}'s blackbox solver:
    
    Example
      L = solveSystem(S)
    Text
      The method {\tt solveSystem} prints the the {\tt PHCpack} input and output file names 
      and returns two solutions. The solutions are of type @TO Point@, defined in @TO NAGtypes@. 
      Each Point comes with diagnostics.
      For example, {\tt LastT} is the end value of the continuation parameter; 
      if it equals 1, then the solver reached the end of the path properly.
    
    Example
      oneSoln = L_0
      peek oneSoln
      
    Text
      The method handles overdetermined systems by inserting slack variables.
      
    Example
      system = {y-x^2, z-x^3, x+y+z-1, x+y+ x^3 -1}
      #system > numcols vars R --overdetermined system
      solns = solveSystem(system);
      numSolns = #solns  

  Caveat
      The method {\tt solveSystem} does not check 
      the dimension of the system; it checks for number of equations instead.
      So {\tt solveSystem} will return an error if there are less equations than unknowns 
      even if the system is zero-dimensional. In addition, if the system is square
      but not zero-dimensional, the output is meaningless.  Thus, it is suggested 
      that the user checks the dimension of the system before using
      {\tt solveSystem}.

      describe ring ideal sys 
    Text
    
      There are denominators, so the method will convert these:
    
    Example
      convertedSys = toLaurentPolynomial(sys,w);    
    Text
    
      The system convertedSys is an equivalent system living in a Laurent polynomial ring.
      For each denominator, a new variable was created starting with w.
    
    Example
      printWidth = 300;
      toString convertedSys
      ring ideal convertedSys
    Text

      Next, notice that the option "Inverses=>true" shows that this is a ring with negative exponents allowed:

    Example
      describe oo 
    Text
    
      Note that if the system is already polynomial, or in Laurent 
      polynomial form, then {\tt toLaurentPolynomial} doesn't change it.
      Of course, sometimes it is possible that the system is polynomial 
      "in disguise" as in line o10 in the following example:
    
    Example
      P = QQ[x,y,z];
      f = (x*y + z^2*y) / y 
      liftable(f,P) 
    Text
    
      But {\tt toLaurentPolynomial} detects this and simplifies the system.
      Instead of creating Laurent polynomials, 
      it updates the system using the following:

      lift(f,P)

  Description
    Text
      The method {\tt topWitnessSet} constructs an embedding 
      for the given polynomial system with the given dimension,
      and then computes generic points on the solution set.  

      The computation of a witness set for the twisted cubic
      is illustrated below.
      
    Example
      R = CC[x,y,z];
      f = { x^2 - y, x^3 - z };
      (w,ns) = topWitnessSet(f,1)
      dim(w)
      degree(w)
      toString equations(w)
      toString slice(w)
      toString points(w)

    Text
      A witness set for the twisted cubic consists of the embedded system,
      a random linear hyperplane to slice the space curve,
      and three generic points.  Observe that the value for the last
      coordinate of all points equals (or is close to) zero.
      This last coordinate corresponds to the added slack variable zzk.
      Solutions with a nonzero value for the slack variable are called
      nonsolutions.  In the example above, the list of nonsolutions 
      returned in ns by {\tt topWitnessSet} was empty.
     
      Often the solution of the embedded system leads to solutions
      with nonzero slack variables, as illustrated in the next example.
    
    Example
      R = CC[x,y,z]; f = { (x^2-y)*(x-2), (x^3 - z)*(y-2), (x*y - z)*(z-2) }
      (w,ns) = topWitnessSet(f,1);
      dim(w)
      degree(w)
      #ns

    Text
      The example is constructed to contain not only the twisted cubic,
      but also at least one isolated point (2,2,2).
      This is reflected in the list of nonsolutions.

      The nonsolutions may be used as start solutions in a cascade of
      homotopies to find generic points on lower dimensional components.

  Description
    Text
      The `gamma trick' refers to the following idea:
      
      If the solutions of the start system are regular, 
      then we avoid singular solutions 
      along the paths by multiplying the start system in the homotopy 
      with a random complex constant {\tt gamma}.     
      This option allows the user to give a specific value of this 
      gamma constant.
    
    Example
      R = CC[x,y]; 
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};

    the degree of the continuation parameter
  Description
    Text
      By default, the homotopy is created with tDegree equal to 2.
      This option allows the user to give another value for tDegree;
      e.g., a linear homotopy between start system q and target system f 
      is of the form (1-t)*q + t*f.
      
      In general, if tDegree is k, then the homotopy is 
      of the form (1-t)^k*q + t^k*f. 
      
      A reason for changing the tDegree would be the following: 
      higher degree homotopies ensure that the system doesn't change as fast 
      in the beginning and at the end of the homotopy; 
      that is, they force smaller step sizes in the beginning and end. 
      The default value, 2, is usually sufficient. 
    
    Example
      R = CC[x,y]; 
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};
      (m,q,qsols) = mixedVolume(f,StartSystem=>true);

  Description
    Text
      Tracking many solution paths is a pleasingly parallel computation.
      A multithreaded path tracker has a number of threads working on
      a queue of path tracking jobs.  Every path tracking job can be
      computed without communication overhead.  For sufficiently large
      problems, the speedup can as large as the number of threads.

  Description
    Text
      For a long path tracking job, one could check the progress of the
      computation by checking the end of the output file.
      A multithreaded path tracker no longer writes the solutions to the
      output file as soon as they are computed.  For path tracking jobs
      that take a very long time, the lack of information on the progress
      can be annoying.  With seeProgess turned on, every thread will write
      a message to screen for each path tracking job.

    Text
      
      A solution has its k-th coordinate zero when the abs function
      evaluates to a number less than or equal to the given tolerance.
    
    Example
      R = CC[x,y];  
      f = { x^3*y^5 + y^2 + x^2*y, x*y + x^2 - 1};
      fSols = solveSystem(f, randomSeed=>3);
      fSols/print
    Text
    
      There is one solution with zero second coordinate:

      zeroSols / print 
    Text
    
      Here is another system where we filter solutions with `small' 
      first coordinate:
    
    Example
      f = {x^2+y^2,y*x+x}; 
      fSols = solveSystem(f);
      fSols/print
      zeroSols = zeroFilter(fSols,0,1.0e-10);
      zeroSols/print
    Text
    
      Good values for the tolerance are relative to the accuracy
      and the condition number of the solution.
      To improve the accuracy of a solution, apply
      @TO refineSolutions@ with a higher working precision.
