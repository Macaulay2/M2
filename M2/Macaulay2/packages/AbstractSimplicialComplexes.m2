     	  The abstractSimplicialComplex that is determined by an abstract simplicial complex 
     Description
     	  Text	  
	     This method returns the AbstractSimplicialComplex that represents a
	     given abstract simplicial complex.
	     The input is either a given collection of generating faces or an integer.
	     These facets need not
	     be facets.  Moreover, the elements of the faces need not be written 
	     in lexiographic order.  When the input is an integer, the output is the
	     corresponding simplex.
	  Example
	       abstractSimplicialComplex({{1,2,3,4}})
	       abstractSimplicialComplex({{4,1,2,3}, {3,2,5},{1,5}})
	       abstractSimplicialComplex(4)
