Workflow

 - edit file
 - git pull
 - git add file.name       Only if file is new, no need if already in the db
 - git commit file.name -m "comment here"
 - git push

 - git status               can be used at any time
 - git checkout file.name   Reverts to previous version (discards your edits)


If editing......
 - git pull   If this does not work (if a conflict)
 - git stash  Stashes changes; they can be applied later
 - git 

MODIFY path in M2

edit the file  ~/Library/Application Support/Macaulay2/init.m2

to include something like
path = {"~/......../M2/Macaulay2/packages/"} | path

===========================================
ToDo

Functionality

- A method to find even one solution to a given problem
- Query this solution:  singular ?  compute its multiplicity ?
   Compute a few and see if they are general or not (i.e. monodromy)
- Functions to help debugging e.g. --verbose, or how talkative it should be

- Document all exported commands
- Maybe don't export as many commands as we now do
