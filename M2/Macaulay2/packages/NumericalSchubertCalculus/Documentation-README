=== Not Exported ===

redChkrPos 
				-- given two brackets, computes the positions of the red checkers in the board
moveRed  
				-- makes the move of the red checkers during a game
moveCheckers 
				-- makes the next move of black and red checkers during a game
				
-- Statistics -- a few functions that count the frequencies of each type of move (of the 3x3 table) 
			  --** Needs to be documented and programmed properly

playCheckers 
				-- given two partitions, plays the combinatorial checkerboard game and outputs the hashtable of the checkermoves played
				-- it is also called recursively to play the next game of the Tournament and creates the Hashtable

makeLocalCoordinates
				-- translates a checkerboard into a matrix with 0s,1s, and variables

solutionToChart
				-- takes a solution matrix in global coordinates and converts it into local coordinates 
				-- (making the linear transformation but just giving the values of the variables)

changeFlags (better name?) (only used when LinearAlgebra is set to false!) ** NEEDS TO BE VERIFIED
				-- function to convert solutions written wrt FlagsA to solutions written wrt FlagsB
				-- it is called recursively: first only makes a change of coordinates (linear transformation)
				-- the other call makes parameter homotopy changing one column at the time

toRawSolutions  
				-- takes solutions in local coordinates written as nxk matrices and just makes the list of values for the variables
						of the local coordinates coordX in the checkerboard variety
						(mainly used for writing solutions for the homotopy functions)

normalizeColumn
				-- given a matrix X, will create a 1 in position X_(r,c) by normalizing the column, i.e.
				-- multiplying the column c by the multip. inverse of X_(r,c) leaving the other columns intact

redCheckersColumnReduce
				-- uses elementary operations to normalize columns according with redChecker positions

redCheckersColumnReduceSwap
				-- specific column reduction used in Ravi's change of coordinates for the swapping move

redCheckersColumnReduce2
				-- specific column reduction used in Ravi's change of coordinates

columnReduce
				-- given a solution matrix and the bracket (where the pivots are) makes 0's in the columns right to the pivots

isRedCheckerInRegionE
				-- Boolean to tell if a checker is northwest

createRandomFlagsForSimpleSchubert
				-- Given two conditions l,m in G(k,n) it produces d = k(n-k)-sum(l)-sum(m) many 
				-- random matrices of size (n-k) x n

				-- Solves a simple Schubert problem using Pieri's homotopy algorithm

skewSchubertVariety 
				-- (used in Pieri-homotopy)
				-- 
checkIncidenceSolution
				--this is only for our tests... shouldn't be used by the user

solutionsToAffineCoords
				-- takes a list of solutions in global coordinates (as matrices)
				   and writes it in terms of the coordinate chart: [**||id]
				   *** This function may fail if the solutions cannot fit this local coordinates
				******* This function is used ONLY in the checkNewtonIteration which in turn is not used anymore
				        however, it is documented (we should remove it from doc.m2)
