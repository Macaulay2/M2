  Description
    Text
      This package is used to define and manipulate noncommutative algebras.  Many of the
      commands contain calls to the existing noncommutative algebra package Bergman.
      
      Detailed instructions for installing Bergman, as well as the NCAlgebra system, can be
      found in the file installNCAlgebra.txt file contained in the NCAlgebra package directory.
      It may also be found at @HREF"https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/blob/master/M2/Macaulay2/packages/NCAlgebra/installNCAlgebra.txt"@.

      NCRing
   Headline
      Type of a noncommutative ring
   Description
      Text
         All noncommutative rings have this as an ancestor type.  It is the parent of the
	 types @ TO NCPolynomialRing @ and @ TO NCQuotientRing @. 
      Text
         In addition to defining a ring as a quotient of a @ TO NCPolynomialRing @, some common ways to create
	 NCRings include @ TO skewPolynomialRing @, @ TO endomorphismRing @, and @ TO oreExtension @.      
      
         Let's consider a three dimensional Sklyanin algebra.  We first define the tensor algebra:
      Example
         A = QQ{x,y,z}
      Text
         Then input the defining relations, and put them in an ideal:
      Example
	 f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
     	 I=ncIdeal{f,g,h}
      Text
         Next, define the quotient ring (as well as try a few functions on this new ring).  Note that
	 when the quotient ring is defined, a call is made to Bergman to compute the Groebner basis
	 of I (out to a certain degree, should the Groebner basis be infinite).
      Example
	 B=A/I
	 generators B
	 numgens B
	 isCommutative B
	 coefficientRing B
      Text
	 As we can see, x is an element of B.
      Example
         x
      Text
         If we define a new ring containing x, x is now part of that new ring
      Example
      	 C = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x,y,z,w}) 
         x
      Text
         We can 'go back' to B using the command @ TO (use, NCRing) @.
      Example
	 use B
	 x
	 use C
      Text
         We can also create an Ore extension.  First define a @ TO NCRingMap @ with @ TO ncMap @.
      Example
	 sigma = ncMap(C,C,{y,z,w,x})
      Text
         Then call the command @ TO oreExtension @.
      Example
	 D = oreExtension(C,sigma,a)
	 generators D
	 numgens D

     I : NCIdeal
   Outputs
     B : NCQuotientRing
   Description
      Text
         This is one way to create a quotient of the tensor algebra modulo some relations.
    
         At this point, one cannot define quotients of quotients.
	 
	 If the base ring is QQ or a finite field of order p, then Bergman is called to compute a
	 Groebner basis.
	 
	 If not, then one has a couple of options.  The first is to take the defining ideal of the algebra, and provide a
	 Groebner Basis by calling @ TO ncGroebnerBasis @ with the InstallGB flag set to true.  Of course, if this generating
	 set is not a Groebner basis, then you will get incorrect results upon calls to functions like @ TO (basis, ZZ, NCRing) @.
	 
	 The alternative is to use the built in commands @ TO skewPolynomialRing @ and @ TO oreExtension @ which
	 has the same effect as above occuring behind the scenes.  Just be careful using these commands to create your
	 ring if your base ring is not a field Bergman can work with, as the generating sets created may not be a Groebner
	 basis for the defining ideal (this is more often a problem for @ TO oreExtension @ than @ TO skewPolynomialRing @).
      Example
         A = QQ{x,y,z}
         f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
     	 I=ncIdeal{f,g,h}
    	 B = A/I

      Text
         This is the type of a matrix over a noncommutative ring.  These represent homomorphisms between two free modules in

	 implemented yet in the @ TO NCAlgebra @ package, but are slated for a later release.

      Code
         UL {TO (ncMatrix, List),
	     TO (basis, ZZ, NCRing),

         Common operations on matrices:

         This is the type of a matrix with entries in an NCRing.  Many of the basic operations

	 the behavior of the functions should be similar to the corresponding 'usual' command.
	 Some examples of creating and using NCMatrices are given below.

      Factor one map through another

   Inputs

   Outputs
      L : NCMatrix
   Description
      Text
         This command factors one map through another.  One nice application
	 of this is to compute twisted matrix factorizations.  
	 If the maps input are homogeneous, then the degrees must match up for the command to work.

         If M does not factor through N, then the return value L is such that M - N*L is the reduction
	 of M modulo a Groebner basis for the image of N.

	 Here is an example of doing so over a PI Sklyanin algebra.  Note that since quotients of
	 quotients are (unfortunately) not yet implemented, we have to do a bit of acrobatics
	 to define the quotient of the Sklyanin we want.
      Example
	 B = threeDimSklyanin(QQ,{1,1,-1},{x,y,z})
         A = ambient B
      Text
         The element g below is central in B (the two is just for convenience).
      Example
	 g = 2*(-y^3-x*y*z+y*x*z+x^3)
	 J = (ideal B) + ncIdeal {g}
	 B' = A/J -- Factor of sklyanin
	 k = ncMatrix {{x,y,z}}
	 BprimeToB = ncMap(B,B',gens B) -- way to lift back from B' to B
	 M = BprimeToB rightKernelBergman rightKernelBergman k  -- second syzygy of k over B
      Text
         At this point, M is maximal Cohen-Macaulay B'-module,
	 and hence the projective dimension of M as a B-module
	 is 1.  Since M is a B' module, multiplication by g on the
	 complex that gives the resolution over B is null homotopic.  This means
	 we may factor the map f through f times the identity.  We do so below.
      Example
	 gId = g*(ncMatrix applyTable(entries id_(ZZ^4), i -> promote(i,B)))
	 assignDegrees(gId,{2,2,2,3},{5,5,5,6});
	 -- now factor through g*id
	 M' = gId // M
	 M*M' == gId

                  set this to true to install a NCGroebnerBasis without verifying that 
		  it is one
   Outputs
     Igb : NCGroebnerBasis
   Description
     Example
       R = QQ[a,b,c,d]/ideal{a*b+c*d}
       A = R {x,y,z}
       I = ncIdeal {a*x*y,b*z^2}
       Igb = ncGroebnerBasis(I, InstallGB=>true)
       c*z^2 % Igb 
       b*z^2 % Igb
     Text
       Note that after the InstallGB flag is set, no checking is done
       to ensure that the input is in fact a Groebner basis.
     Example
       A = QQ{x,y,z}
       p = y*z + z*y - x^2
       q = x*z + z*x - y^2
       r = z^2 - x*y - y*x
       I = ncIdeal {p,q,r}
       Igb = ncGroebnerBasis I
     Text
       If the InstallGB flag is not set, then a call to Bergman is made, if the base ring is @ TO QQ @ or a finite field
       of characteristic p.  Otherwise, an error is raised.
       
       Now we can do things with an ncgb, like compute normal forms (using the Bergman interface).
     Example
       normalFormBergman(z^17,Igb)
     Text
       Or using the built in reduction code:
     Example
       z^17 % Igb
     Text
       Calls to Bergman are usually faster, except for when the polynomial is small.  See the documentation
       for @ TO (symbol %, NCRingElement, NCGroebnerBasis) @ for details on controlling when Bergman is called.

   Description
      Text
        This command reads in a Groebner basis from a Bergman output file.
	It can be useful if you have performed a lengthy computation before,
	and wish to load in a previously computed result to do some computations.
      
        The Groebner basis we are reading in for this example is located in the NCAlgebra
	auxiliary files directory. We are currently unable to compile this documentation 
	node in a way that enables M2 to read the file. We give a text version of the
	session until the issue is resolved.
      Example
        A=QQ{x56,x46,x36,x26,x16,x45,x35,x25,x15,x34,x24,x14,x23,x13,x12}
      Text
	I = gbFromOutputFile(A,"NCAlgebra/FK.bo", ReturnIdeal=>true)
      Text
	B=A/I
	-- The gb in the file is up to degree 6
      Text
        hilbertSeries(B,Order=>4)	
      Text
        In "Quadratic algebras, Dunkl elements, and Schubert calculus," Fomin and Kirillov
        introduce a family of noncommutative algebras E_n which may be thought of as the 
        quadratic closure of the ring of "Bruhat operators" acting on a vector space whose 
        basis is the symmetric group. In that paper, they provide Hilbert series for the 
        algebras E_1, ..., E_5. The file loaded above is a Groebner basis of E_6 to degree 6.
        Thus B is isomorphic to E_6 in low degrees.

	 the x_i must satisfy for the element x_1*b_1+...+x_n*b_n to be normal in A.
      Text
         Before computing the normal variety, this method checks for normal monomials
	 in degree n. These are returned first to reduce the complexity of the problem.

         The normal elements in degree 2 are x^2, y^2 and z^2. The basis
	 calculation shows x^2 and y^2 are normal forms in B. The normalElements
	 method first checks all basis monomials using @ TO isNormal @. In this case
	 it finds x^2 and y^2 are normal and returns this information. However,  
	 z^2 is not a normal form expression. The normal form of z^2 is x*y+y*x. In 
	 the second phase of the calculation, the method returns generators of the
	 ideal describing the normal elements (excluding the normal monomials). We
	 see the coefficients of basis monomials y*z and x*z must be 0 and the 
	 coefficients of x*y and y*x must be equal. The last equation identifies
	 z^2 = x*y+y*x as a normal element of degree 2.

	 For large matrices or large values of n, it may save memory to break the calculation

         The quadratic closure of an NCIdeal in an NCPolynomialRing is the NCIdeal
	 generated by the elements of degree at most 2. Commonly used with 
	 Link to homogDual in the case where the ideal generators are homogeneous of
	 degree greater than 1.
	 
	 If the input is an NCQuotientRing, the method is applied to the defining
	 ideal of the quotient ring and the corresponding quotient ring is returned.
	 At the moment, quotients of quotients is not implemented, and the ambient
	 ring of the input NCQuotientRing is assumed to be an NCPolynomialRing.
	 
	 This method is commonly used in conjunction with @ TO homogDual @.
      Example

   Description
      Text
         Generally, linear algebra in graded rings is performed using the monomial basis
	 obtained from a Groebner basis calculation. In some cases, it is desirable to 
	 work relative to a different basis. This method calls @ TO sparseCoeffs @ to 
	 compute the coordinate vector(s) of a ring element (or a list of ring elements) 
	 relative to a user-specified basis.
	 If no basis is specified, the method simple calls @ TO sparseCoeffs @ with no
	 options.    
      Example
         R = QQ[w]/ideal(w^2+w+1)
	 A = skewPolynomialRing(R,promote(-1,R),{x,y,z})
      Text
         One motivating example comes from invariant theory. In this example, we take
	 a skew polynomial ring in three variables and act by the cyclic subgroup of graded
	 automorphisms of A generated by permuting the variables. A basis for the fixed ring
	 is given by "orbit sums" of basis monomials. Here we work in homogeneous degree 3.
      Example
	 g = ncMap(A,A,{y,z,x})
	 gList = {g, g^2, g^3}
	 a = sum apply(3,i-> (gList#i)(x^3))
	 b = sum apply(3,i-> (gList#i)(x^2*y))
	 c = sum apply(3,i-> (gList#i)(x*y^2))
	 d = sum apply(3,i-> (gList#i)(x*y*z))
      Text
         It is clear that these are linearly independent. Next, we take a homogeneous
	 polynomial of degree 3, make it invariant, and compute its coordinate vector.
      Example
         p = w^2*z^2*y+x^2*z+(1-w)*y^3
	 g(p)==p
	 p' = sum apply(3,i-> (gList#i)(p))
	 g(p')==p'
	 coordinates(p',Basis=>{a,b,c,d})

         This method constructs a skew polynomial ring with coefficients in the ring R
	 and generators from the list L. A valid input matrix is a square matrix over R
	 with at least #L rows such that M_{ij} = M_{ji}^{(-1)} and M_{ii}=1. The relations of the 
	 resulting ring have the form g_i*g_j - M_{ij}*g_j*g_i. If R is a Bergman coefficient
	 ring, an NCGroebnerBasis is computed for B.

      "Basic operations on noncommutative algebras"
   Description
      Text 
         The NCAlgebra package contains a number of methods for studying noncommutative
	 rings - primarily graded rings. The following three extended examples 
	 highlight the capabilites of the package. For a detailed account of the
	 Groebner basis calculations underlying nearly all of these methods, see
	 @ TO "Using the Bergman interface" @.
      Text
         Our first example concerns a three-dimensional Sklyanin algebra. This example is
	 a PI-ring. We define the ring as a quotient of the tensor algebra on three
	 generators by the two-sided ideal generated by the three elements listed.
      Example
         A = QQ{x,y,z}
      Text
         Users familiar with Macaulay2 will recognize the notation for a ring of
	 noncommutative polynomials is identical to that for local rings, see
	 @ TO (symbol SPACE, Ring, List) @. Thus the
	 previous line does not generate an error if you forget to load the NCAlgebra package. 
      Example
	 f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
	 B = A/ncIdeal{f,g,h}
      Text
         It is known that this algebra has a unique (up to rescaling) central element 
	 of degree 3. We can verify this claim computationally using @ TO centralElements @
	 and check that the element is regular to a given degree. See @ TO isLeftRegular @.
      Example
         centralElements(B,3)
	 j = y^3+x*y*z-y*x*z-x^3
	 isCentral j
	 apply(5,i->isLeftRegular(j,i+1))
      Text
         In fact, we can see that j is (up to scaling) the only normal element of degree 3.
	 See the discussion above for interpreting the output of @ TO normalElements @.
      Example
         normalElements(B,3,n,o)
	 basis(3,B)
      Text
         Recently, we studied noncommutative matrix factorizations over noncommutative
	 hypersurfaces. Here is a simple example. The hypersurface is B/(j). However,
	 iterated quotients are not yet implemented, so we define this ring as a 
	 quotient of the tensor algebra. Note the use of "promote" to ensure j is 
	 thought of as an element of the tensor algebra.
      Example
         use A
	 I = B.ideal
         J = ncIdeal promote(j,A)
	 B' = A/(I+J) 
      Text
         As in the commutative case, any minimal free resolution of a finitely generated
	 module over a noncommutative hypersurface is eventually given by a matrix 
	 factorization. We resolve the trivial module for B' by expressing it as the 
	 cokernel of a homogeneous matrix. 
      Example     
	 k = ncMatrix {gens B'}
	 M = rightKernelBergman rightKernelBergman k
	 N = rightKernelBergman M
      Text
         As discussed in @ TO "Using the Bergman interface" @, the method 
	 @ TO rightKernelBergman @ only computes the kernel of a module map to a 
	 certain homogeneous degree. Applying a theorem of Cassidy and Shelton, we
	 can be sure the matrices in any minimal graded free resolution of the trivial 
	 module of B' will have entries of homogeneous degree at most 3.	 
	 Thus we conclude M is the third syzygy 
	 module and N is the fourth. If we lift these matrices we see that M and N are
	 nearly a factorization of the central element j.
      Example       
	 BprimeToB = ncMap(B,B',gens B)
     	 liftM = BprimeToB M
	 liftN = BprimeToB N
	 liftM*liftN
      Text
         It appears that a change of basis will produce a matrix factorization. In general,
	 Bergman returns a generating set for the kernel, but it need not have any
	 nice properties. Here the NCAlgebra package can help by factoring a map. We 
	 would like M*M' = M'*M = j*I where I is the identity matrix.
      Example  	
	 jId = promote(j,B)*(ncMatrix applyTable(entries id_(ZZ^4), i -> promote(i,B)))
	 assignDegrees(jId,{2,2,2,3},{5,5,5,6});
      Text 
         The matrix jId is diagonal, and we have assigned degrees to make it compatible
	 with M. Now we factor the lift of M through jId.
      Example
	 M' = jId // liftM
         N
      Text
         We see that M' and N describe the same submodule and we check that the 
	 factorization worked:
      Example         
	 liftM*M' 
	 M'*liftM 
      Text
         The user can create noncommutative rings in ways other than specifying a
	 presentation. For our second example, consider a skew polynomial ring on four
	 generators, where generators skew-commute (but are not nilpotent). See
	 @ TO skewPolynomialRing @ for more details.
      Example
         C = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x,y,z,w})
      Text
         Let us briefly note that the user can also define a skew polynomial ring 
	 with coefficients in a commutative ring.
      Example
         R = QQ[q]/ideal{q^4+q^3+q^2+q+1}
	 B = skewPolynomialRing(R,q,{x,y,z,w})
	 x*y == q*y*x         
      Text
         Returning to the main example, we can define a graded Ore extension of C 
	 by specifying an automorphism.
	 The function @ TO ncMap @ is used to define a ring map. Note that ring maps 
	 are linear and multiplicative by definition but are not assumed to be  well-defined. 
      Example
         use C
         sigma = ncMap(C,C,{y,z,w,x})
	 isWellDefined sigma
      Text
         We form the Ore extension of C by sigma. See @ TO oreExtension @.
      Example         
         D = oreExtension(C,sigma,a)
      Text
         The new generator a is normal and regular in D. Regularity (on the left or right)
	 can be checked one homogeneous degree at a time. See @ TO isLeftRegular @. 
	 Thus a determines a graded automorphism f:D->D via a*r=f(r)*a.
      Example
         isNormal a
	 apply(5,i-> isLeftRegular(a,i+1))
         sigmaD = normalAutomorphism a
      Text
	 Given an automorphism, one can check to see which elements it normalizes
	 in any given degree.
      Example       
         normalElements(sigmaD,1)
	 normalElements(sigmaD,2)
      Text
         One can check for the presence of normal elements more generally. In our
	 example, since a is normal, a^2 will also be normal. It is the only normal
	 monomial of degree 2. A complete description of the normal elements in a
	 given degree is given by @ TO normalElements @. 
      Example
         normalElements(D,2,P,Q)
      Text
         Each component of the "normal variety" is a set of polynomial equations which must
	 be satisfied by the coefficients of the monomial basis for an element expressed
	 in that basis to be normal. In this case, the basis of D in degree 2 is
      Example
         basis(2,D)	 
      Text
         The output of normalElements tells us that in order for a degree 2 element of D
	 to be normal, it must be an expresison in powers of the generators. The coefficients
	 of these powers must satisfy the six equations listed.
      Example
         isNormal (x^2+z^2-y^2-w^2)	 
      Text
         In Macaulay2, the user can define a polynomial ring to be commutative or 
	 skew-commutative (the exterior algebra). The user can convert these rings (and
	 their quotients) to a type compatible with the NCAlgebra package using 
         @ TO toNCRing @.
      Example
         E' = QQ[x,y,z,w,SkewCommutative=>true]
	 E = toNCRing E'
	 f = ncMap(E,C,gens E)
	 f x^2       
	 use C
	 x^2 == 0
      Text
         Conversely, the user can convert an NCRing to a (quotient of a) polynomial ring
	 in the usual sense of Macaulay2 using @ TO toM2Ring @. This method works on any
	 NCRing - the result is the abelianization or "exterior-ization" of the given ring.
	 For example, if we abelianize the skew polynomial ring C, we get a ring in which
	 only powers of the generators are nonzero. On the other hand, if we "exterior-ize"
	 C, we get the exterior algebra.
      Example
         C' = toM2Ring C
         x*y 
	 x*x
	 C'' = toM2Ring(C,SkewCommutative=>true)
         y*x
	 y*y
      Text
         Finally, we can construct the opposite ring. The opposite ring of D will be the
	 Ore extension by the inverse of sigma. See @ TO oppositeRing @.
      Example
         Dop = oppositeRing D
         a*x == w*a            
	 use D
	 a*w == x*a

      Text
         Our last extended example illustrates how to obtain a presentation for the
	 endomorphism ring of a module over a commutative ring. First we define a
	 hypersurface ring and a high syzygy module.
      Example
         Q = QQ[a,b,c]
	 R = Q/ideal{a*b-c^2}
	 kRes = res(coker vars R, LengthLimit=>7);
	 M = coker kRes.dd_5
      Text
         The endomorphism ring is computed using @ TO endomorphismRing @. This method
	 computes a presentation, but the presentation is typically not minimal. We
	 see from the following calcuation that X_3 = X_0X_2.
      Example
         B = endomorphismRing(M,X);

   Description
      Text
         Bergman is a software package for computing Groebner bases 
	 for ideals in both commutative and noncommutative polynomial 
	 rings with coefficients in Q or Z/p. Bergman was created by 
	 J. Backelin (U. of Stockholm) and its capabilites were extended 
	 by V. Ufnarovski, S. Cojacaru, and A. Podoplelov.
      Text
         Though Bergman is limited in terms of the coefficients it can 
	 handle and the choice of orderings it offers, it is a very 
	 efficient (especially in terms of memory usage) open source
	 program for computing noncommutative Groebner bases. (In the future
	 we may add support for other Groebner basis software.) 
	 Rather than re-inventing this wheel, the
	 NCAlgebra package makes extensive use of Bergman calls for
	 noncommutative Groebner basis calculations. The following 
	 examples illustrate some common calculations which involve
	 a call to Bergman. Our goal is to provide a more intuitive 
	 user experience with minimal compromises to efficiency. 
      Text
         Typically, the user begins by defining a noncommutative polynomial
	 ring. By default, the ring is graded with generators in degree 1.
	 Other gradings can be defined, see @ TO setWeights @.
      Example
         A = QQ{x,y,z}
      Text
         Implicit in this definition is a choice of ordering for Groebner basis
	 calculations: the ordering is degree-lexicographic with the generator
	 symbols listed in order from smallest to largest. Ring elements are 
	 displayed with the high term listed first.
      Example
         p = y*z + z*y - x^2
      Text
         One can try to compute Groebner bases for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous ideals.
	 We cannot ensure Bergman computes any other than the homogeneous case correctly. 
	 We consider only homogeneous examples, the inhomogeneous case being similar.
      Example
         q = x*z + z*x - y^2
       	 r = z^2 - x*y - y*x
       	 I = ncIdeal {p,q,r}
      Text
         NCAlgebra has three methods pertaining to  noncommutative
	 Groebner bases. One is @ TO twoSidedNCGroebnerBasisBergman @. This command
	 runs Bergman to compute a noncommutative Groebner basis to a certain degree.
	 The user will recall that unlike the commutative case, noncommutative 
	 Groebner bases need not be finite, and may grow rapidly. For unfamiliar
	 examples, we recommend initially setting a relatively low degree threshhold 
	 (say, n=5). In our example, we know from experience the Groebner basis is finite
	 so we do not specify a degree limit.
      Example
          Igb = twoSidedNCGroebnerBasisBergman I
      Text
          One an NCGroebner basis has been calculated, it is cached for later use. This
	  option can be disabled. See @ TO twoSidedNCGroebnerBasisBergman @ for more
	  on options. We note that twoSidedNCGroebnerBasisBergman is called automatically
	  any time the user attempts to create an @ TO NCQuotientRing @.
      Text
          Another method related to Groebner bases is @ TO ncGroebnerBasis @. This 
	  method creates the @ TO NCGroebnerBasis @ object. By default, this method
	  also calls Bergman for a noncommutative Groebner basis calculation. However,
	  by setting the option InstallGB to true, the user instructs Macaulay2 to bypass 
          the Bergman call and accept the input list as a Groebner basis without checking
	  it is one. This can be useful when the coefficient ring is not @ TO QQ @ or a finite
	  prime field.
      Example
         Igb2 = ncGroebnerBasis(I,InstallGB=>true) 
      Text
         As mentioned above, noncommutative Groebner bases can grow rapidly both in the
	 number and size of the terms. In some cases, it takes days to calcuate a 
	 Groebner basis to the desired degree. So as not to repeat this calculation 
	 more than once, users might have a Groebner basis saved in a file. The method
	 @ TO gbFromOutputFile @ enables the user to load the Groebner basis from a file.
	 The file should contain nothing besides a list of noncommutative polynomials in
	 Macaulay2 readable form. (One exception: Bergman output files contain lines 
	 beginning with the "%" symbol. gbFromOutputFile ignores lines beginning with a
	 "%".) Bergman users: you need not alter the output file from ncpbhgroebner in any
         way prior to calling gbFromOutputFile. See @ TO gbFromOutputFile @ for an example.
      Text
         Once a Groebner basis is computed, many methods become available. The most
	 basic calculation is to return the normal form of a given element relative
	 to the known Groebner basis. The NCAlgebra package also provides multiple 
	 options for this calculation. 
      Text
         Generally speaking, Bergman is the most efficient way to reduce a ring 
	 element to normal form. Behind the scenes, the NCAlgebra package creates a
	 Bergman-readable input file, runs a Bergman session, and interprets the 
	 output, which it displays to the user. This takes time, especially when the
	 Groebner basis is large. The NCAlgebra package has its own normal form
	 reduction algorithm. It is considerably slower than Bergman, but it can
	 be faster than the time required to execute the Bergman call. 
      Text
         The file NCAlgebra.m2 contains two environment variables: MAXDEG and MAXSIZE.
	 If the element to be reduced has degree less than MAXDEG and fewer than MAXSIZE
	 terms (or if the coefficient ring is not Q or Z/p), the NCAlgebra package calls
	 its own normal form reduction method. Otherwise, it calls @ TO normalFormBergman @.
	 The user can force a Bergman call using this method.
      Example
          z^17 % Igb
          normalFormBergman(z^17,Igb)
      Text
         Normal form calculations are performed automatically in an @ TO NCQuotientRing @.
      Example
         B = A/I
	 z^17
      Text
         We also use Bergman to compute Hilbert series of an @ TO NCQuotientRing @ using 
	 the @ TO hilbertBergman @ command. By default, the Hilbert series is given to 
	 degree 10. As mentioned above, we suggest reducing the degree limit for rings
	 whose growth is not well understood beforehand.
      Example
         hilbertBergman B 
      Text
         Perhaps a major achievement of the NCAlgebra package is the method 
	 @ TO rightKernelBergman @. The functionality described above involves only
	 the most basic Bergman calls, and long time Bergman users may find little
	 reason to prefer NCAlgebra on those grounds. On the other hand, computing 
	 kernel generators for a matrix with entries in a noncommutative ring is 
	 anything but straightforward, and we reduce the call to a single command.
      Example
         B = threeDimSklyanin(QQ,{1,1,-1},{x,y,z})
         A = ambient B
	 g = -y^3-x*y*z+y*x*z+x^3
         C = A/(ideal B + ncIdeal g)
         M = ncMatrix {{x,y,z,0}, {-y*z-2*x^2,-y*x,z*x-x*z,x},{x*y-2*y*x,x*z,-x^2,y}, {-y^2-z*x,x^2,-x*y,z}}
      Text
         For details about matrices over noncommutative rings, see @ TO NCMatrix @.
	 Provided the entries of M are homogeneous and their degrees are compatible,
	 M can be viewed as a graded (degree 0) homomorphism of graded free B-modules.
	 For more on this degree-compatibility, see @ TO assignDegrees @.
      Example
         assignDegrees(M,{1,0,0,0},{2,2,2,1})
      Text
         Now, we can compute the kernel of M. It is always assumed that M determines a 
	 map of graded right modules. As always in the noncommutative case, computing
	 generators of the kernel of a map is generally an infinite linear algebra
	 problem. The @ TO rightKernelBergman @ method returns a set of minimal kernel
	 generators to degree 10, or to the degree specified by the user.
      Example
         ker1M = rightKernelBergman(M)
         M*ker1M == 0
      Text
         In principle, this method can be used to compute the minimal free resolution
	 of a finitely generated B-module with known presentation up to a specified degree.
      Example
         ker2M = rightKernelBergman(ker1M)
	 ker3M = rightKernelBergman(ker2M)
