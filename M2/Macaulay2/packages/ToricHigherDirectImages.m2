        computations involving pushforwards and higher direct images of toric maps
    Description
        Text
	    Given a morphism of varieties $\varphi \colon X \rightarrow Y$, we have
	    the pushforward functor $\varphi_*$ from the category of coherent sheaves
	    on $X$ to coherent sheaves on $Y$. This functor is not right-exact, and so
	    there is a right-derived functor $R^i \varphi_*$ from the bounded derived
	    category $D^b(X)$ to $D^b(Y)$, which we call the higher direct image functor.
	    When both $X$ and $Y$ are toric varieties, coherent sheaves arise from
	    finitely generated multigraded modules over their Cox rings. Thus, for a
	    given coherent sheaf $\mathcal{F}$, there are finitely generated graded
	    modules over the Cox ring of $Y$ which sheafifies to $R^i \varphi_* \mathcal{F}$.
        Text
	    The purpose of this package is to compute (higher) direct images of
	    toric morphisms $\varphi \colon X \rightarrow Y$ between smooth
	    projective toric varieties. This is currently implemented in two
	    situations:
	Text
	    1) When $\varphi$ is a toric fibration, i.e. a surjective
	    toric morphism with $\varphi_* \mathcal{O}_X = \mathcal{O}_Y$,
	    then the method \texttt{HDI} allows one to compute the higher direct
	    images of a line bundle $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ on $X$. In "Reduced \v{C}ech complexes and computing higher direct 
	    images under toric maps", M. Roth provides a constructive method for producing
	    this module and S. Zotine adapts that method into an algorithm. This package
	    provides the implementation of this algorithm. 
	Text
	    For instance, if $X$ is a blowup of $\mathbb{P}^2$, then the first higher direct
	    image of $O_X(3E)$ is nontrivial, where $E$ is the exceptional divisor.
	Example
	    X = hirzebruchSurface 1;
	    Y = toricProjectiveSpace 2;
	    phi = map(Y, X, matrix{{0,-1},{1,0}});
	    D = {0,3,0,0};
	    prune HDI(phi, 1, D)
	Text
	    2) When $\varphi \colon Y \rightarrow Y$ is a toric Frobenius map, i.e.
	    induced from the natural morphism on the dense torus given by raising all
	    of the coordinates to the same power, then the method \texttt{frobeniusDirectImage}
	    allows one to compute pushforwards of any coherent sheaf. For instance,
	    the pushforward of the trivial bundle on $\mathbb{P}^2$ by the second Frobenius map
	    splits into 4 line bundles.
	Example
	    S = ring Y;
	    frobeniusDirectImage(2,S^1)

        compute the pushforward of a module under the $p$th toric Frobenius map

	    which is the pushforward of M under the $p$th toric Frobenius.
    Description
        Text
	    The $p$th toric Frobenius is a toric morphism $F_p \colon X \rightarrow X$
	    which is the extension of the natural group homomorphism $T_X \rightarrow T_X$
	    given by raising all coordinates to the $p$th power. This allows one to view the
	    Cox ring $R$ of $X$ as a module over itself, with the module action being
	    $r \cdot m :\!= r^p m$. The extension of this action to modules also allows one
	    to compute the pushforward by $F_p$. Note that $p$ need not be prime, nor related
	    to the characteristic of the ground field in any way.
	    Here is the 4th pushforward of the Cox ring of the first Hirzebruch surface.
	Example
	    X = hirzebruchSurface 1;
	    R = ring X;
	    frobeniusDirectImage(4, R^1)
	Text
	    We can pushforward many kinds of modules. Here is the pushforward of an ideal.
	Example
	    I = module ideal {R_0, R_2};
	    prune frobeniusDirectImage(2, I)
	Text
	    Here is the pushforward of a free module.
	Example
	    F = R^{{1,0},{0,1}};
	    frobeniusDirectImage(2, F)
	Text
	    Here is the pushforward of a torsion module.
	Example
	    M = R^1/(module I)
	    prune frobeniusDirectImage(2, M)
	Text
	    As mentioned, $p$ is not related to the characteristic of the field, and the
	    outputs will be the same modules over a different coefficient ring.
	Example
	    Y = hirzebruchSurface(1, CoefficientRing => ZZ/2);
	    S = ring Y;
	    I' = module ideal {S_0, S_2};
	    prune frobeniusDirectImage(2, I')

	    a vector presumed to be in the nef cone of $X$
    Outputs
	  : ToricMap
    Description
        Text
	    A vector in the nef cone of a toric variety determines an embedding
	    of the toric variety via GIT quotients. When the vector lies on the boundary
	    of the nef cone, the resulting embedding is typically a "smaller" toric variety
	    on which the original variety can surject. These types of maps are commonly
	    used in the minimal model program (MMP)
	Text
	    More precisely, see Lemma 14.4.6 and Theorem 15.1.10 in HREF("https://dacox.people.amherst.edu/toric.html", 
	    "Toric varieties"). The nef cone of a toric variety is a GKZ chamber and each
	    face of this cone is also a GKZ chamber, hence the nef cone of another toric variety.
	    Since both of these are GIT quotients, there is a natural map induced by the projection
	    of vector spaces between the quotients, which this method produces.
	Text
	    The first Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_1$ comes with two natural maps to
	    $\mathbb{P}^1$ (projection to the base) and $\mathbb{P}^2$ (the blowdown map).
	    Both of these can be realized as maps obtained from the MMP.
	Example
	    X = hirzebruchSurface 1;
	    pi1 = nefContraction(X, vector {1,0})
	    assert(isWellDefined pi1);
	    assert(isProjective target pi1 and dim target pi1 == 1);
	    pi2 = nefContraction(X, matrix {{0},{1}})
	    assert(isProjective target pi1 and dim target pi2 == 2);
	    assert(rank picardGroup target pi2 == 1);
	Text
	    If the vector is in the interior of the nef cone, then the resulting toric variety
	    is the same as the original, and so the resulting surjection is just the identity.
	Example
	    idty = nefContraction(X,{1,1})
	    assert(rays target idty == rays X);
	    assert(max target idty == max X);

        Text
	    This method is the implementation of Algorithm A.5 in 
	    "Reduced \v{C}ech complexes and computing higher direct 
	    images under toric maps". More precisely, the higher direct image
	    sheaf inherits a trivial torus action by the kernel torus
	    $T_K :\!= \ker \phi\vert_{T_X}$, and so splits into a direct sum
	    of sheaves indexed by eigencharacters. This method computes these
	    characters, as well as a pair of divisors $(D,E)$ for use in
	    Algorithm A.8 which computes the higher direct image sheaf.
	Example
	    X = hirzebruchSurface 1;

	Text
	    One might hope that the set of eigencharacters is a convex set,

	    torus fixed points and phi is the projection to $\mathbb{P}^1$,
	    we can find an example of a line bundle whose eigencharacters are not convex.

	Text
	    The first Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_1$ has two geometric interpretations: 1) as the projective
	    bundle $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1} \oplus \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^1})$
	    or as the blowup of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at a torus-fixed point. In both cases we get a
	    toric morphism, the projection and blowdown map. In the first case, the (higher) direct images
	    of a line bundle are themselves vector bundles, and hence split.
	Example
	    X = hirzebruchSurface 1;
