		Matroids
	Headline
		a package for computations with matroids
	Description
		Text
			A matroid is a combinatorial structure abstracting the notion of 
			(linear algebraic, graph-theoretic) independence. This package 
			provides methods to perform computations with matroids in Macaulay2.

			This package provides capabilities for converting between various 
			representations of matroids, creating linear and graphic 
			matroids from a matrix or graph, forming and detecting existence 
			of minors, computing Tutte polynomials, and additional 
			functions for applications of matroids to areas like optimization and
			convex geometry.

			Matroids are stored as pairs (E, B) of a ground set E and a list B of bases, 
			which are maximal independent subsets of the ground set. Internally, a 
			ground set of size n is always identified with the set $\{0, ..., n-1\}$, and 
			thus all subsets of the ground set (e.g. bases, circuits, flats) are also treated 
			as subsets of $\{0, ..., n-1\}$ (for more, cf. @TO groundSet@). However, the 
			actual elements of the ground set are allowed to be arbitrary (e.g. 
			integers, symbols, vectors, edges in a graph), and can be accessed by
			@TO2{(symbol _, Matroid, List), "taking subscripts"}@.
			
		Example
			M = matroid({a, matrix{{-1.2},{3.78}}, x, set{4,6}, -9}, {{a, x}, {x, -9}})
			peek M
			M_{0,1,4}
			peek restriction(M, set{1,2,3})
			circuits M
			netList flats M
			tuttePolynomial M
			
		Text
			A matroid can be specified by its bases, nonbases, circuits, from a 
			matrix, graph, or ideal, or via a collection of predefined matroids. For more 
			on how to construct a matroid, see @TO matroid@.

	Description
		Text
			To see how to specify a matroid, see @TO matroid@.

			In this package, the ground set of the matroid is always (internally) 
			assumed to be a set of the form $\{0, ..., n-1\}$. This means that 
			although the actual elements of the ground set can be arbitrary, 
			all subsets of the ground set are specified by their indices, i.e. 
			as a subset of $\{0, ..., n-1\}$ (this includes bases, circuits, flats, 
			loops, etc.). 
			
			For convenience, the user can specify a subset of the ground set
			either by indices (which are integers between 0 and n-1), or as 
			actual elements. If indices are used, they should be given as a 
			@TO Set@, and if elements are used, they should be given as a 
			@TO List@.
			
			One can use the function @TO indicesOf@ to convert elements of
			the ground set to their indices. Conversely, use 
			@TO2{(symbol _, Matroid, List), "subscripts"}@
			to obtain the elements from their indices. 
			
			A recommended way to circumvent this distinction between indices 
			and elements is to make the elements of M equal to integers from 0 
			to n-1, in which case an element is equal to its index in M.groundSet.
			
			For more on this package-wide convention, see @TO groundSet@.
		
		Example
			U24 = uniformMatroid(2, 4)
			U24 == dual U24
			ideal U24
			peek U24
			tuttePolynomial U24
			N = U24 / {0}
			areIsomorphic(N, uniformMatroid(1, 3))
		Text
			
			Many computations performed in this package are 
			cached in order to speed up subsequent 
			calculations (as well as avoiding redundancy). 
			These include the @TO circuits@, @TO flats@, 
			@TO2{(ideal, Matroid), "ideal"}@,
			@TO2{(rank, Matroid, Set), "rank function"}@, and
			@TO2{(tuttePolynomial, Matroid), "Tutte polynomial"}@
			of a matroid, and are stored in the 
			@TO CacheTable@ of the matroid. Since the cache is
			a @TO MutableHashTable@, the user can also manually
			cache data (e.g. if it has been computed in a previous
			session), which can greatly speed up computation.

			R10 = specificMatroid "R10"

			The default representation of a matroid in this package is by 
			its ground set and list of bases. 
			
		Example
			M = matroid({a,b,c,d}, {{a,b},{a,c}})
			peek M
		Text

			One can create a matroid by specifying its @TO circuits@ or 
			@TO nonbases@ instead, using the option 
			@TO2{[matroid, EntryMode], "EntryMode"}@. Regardless of the 
			value of EntryMode, the bases 
			are automatically computed in the process of creation.
			
		Example
			M = matroid({a,b,c,d},{}, EntryMode => "nonbases") -- defaults to uniform matroid of full rank
			peek M
			N = matroid({a,b,c,d}, {{b,c}}, EntryMode => "circuits")
			peek N
		Text	
		
			If no ground set is provided, the ground set is taken to be the 
			union of the basis/nonbasis/circuit elements. 
			
		Example
			M = matroid {{a,b},{a,c}}
			peek M
		Text

			If a matrix is provided, then the realizable matroid on the 
			columns of the matrix is returned. The ground set consists of
			columns of the matrix, and independence is determined by 
			the method @TO rank@ (to allow flexibility over general rings).
		
		Example
			M = matroid random(ZZ^3, ZZ^5)
			peek M
		Text
		
			If a graph is provided, then the graphic matroid is returned.
			The ground set consists of edges in the graph, and circuits 
			are precisely the (minimal) cycles in the graph. 
				
		Example
			M = matroid completeGraph 3
			peek M
		Text
		
			One can use the optional arguments Loops and ParallelEdges
			to specify loops and parallel edges for the graph, respectively.
			These options are intended only for use with graphic matroids
			(since the Graphs package does not provide functionality
			for loops or parallel edges). ParallelEdges should be given as a
			list of edges (which are two-element sets of the form set$\{i,j\}$
			where i, j are vertices in G), and Loops should be given as a 
			list of vertices where the loops are based.
			
		Example
			M = matroid(completeGraph 3, ParallelEdges => {set{0,1},set{0,1},set{1,2}}, Loops => {0,2})
			peek M
			circuits M
		Text
			
			If a squarefree monomial ideal is provided, corresponding to a 
			simplicial complex &Delta; via the Stanley-Reisner correspondence,
			then the matroid with 
			@TO2{(independenceComplex, Matroid), "independence complex"}@
			&Delta; is returned. The ground set consists of the variables in the
			ring of the ideal.
			
		Example
			R = QQ[x_0..x_4]
			I = monomialIdeal (x_0*x_1*x_3,x_1*x_2*x_4,x_0*x_2*x_3*x_4)
			M = matroid I

			Two matroids are considered equal if they have the same

			The strong comparison operator === should not be used, as 
			bases (and ground sets) are internally stored as lists rather 
			than sets, so the same matroid with a different ordering on 
			the list of bases (or ground set) will be treated as different 
			under ===. (One might try to sort the list of bases, but

			grow rapidly with the size of the ground set.)

		Text
			A matroid is determined by its set of bases, i.e. maximal 
			(with respect to inclusion) independent sets, which are all 
			of the same size (namely, the rank of the matroid). However, 
			many interesting matroids have relatively few dependencies, 
			and thus it may be easier to specify the matroid by its 
			@TO nonbases@, i.e. dependent subsets of the ground set, with 
			size equal to the rank of the matroid.

			Similarly, a matroid can be specified by its @TO circuits@, i.e. 
			minimal dependent sets. This is done e.g. when creating 
			a graphical matroid.
			
			If EntryMode is not specified, then the default value is assumed, 
			which is EntryMode => "bases".

			Returns the internal representation of the ground set.
			
			Important: read the following if you encounter errors when 
			specifying subsets of a matroid (e.g. 
			restriction/deletion/contraction, rank of subset, etc.)
			
			For a matroid M, there are 2 important differences between 
			M.groundSet and the elements of M (given by 
			@TO2{(symbol _*, Matroid), "M_*"}@). First is data 
			types: M.groundSet is a @TO Set@, and M&#95;* is a @TO List@. 
			Second, M.groundSet always consists of integers from 0 to n-1, 
			where n is the number of elements of M: on the other hand,
			the elements of M themselves can be arbitrary (e.g. symbols, 
			matrices, edges in a graph, etc.).
			
			Thus, one can think of M.groundSet as the
			set of indices of the elements in the list M&#95;*: the first
			element of M has index 0, corresponding to the 
			element 0 in M.groundSet; the second element of M 
			has index 1, etc. 
			
			The key point is that all sets associated to the structure of a 
			matroid - bases, circuits, flats, etc. - are subsets of M.groundSet
			(not M&#95;*). In particular, they are also of class @TO Set@
			(although a collection of them is usually a @TO List@), and 
			are also indexed from 0 to n-1. (An exception here is loops and
			coloops, which are given as a list of indices, rather than
			single-element sets).
			
			A recommended way to circumvent this distinction between indices 
			and elements is to use $\{0, ..., n-1\}$ as the actual elements of M, 
			in which case an element is equal to its index in M.groundSet. Most methods
			in this package will accept either a list of elements or a set of indices,
			and if the elements of M are $\{0, ..., n-1\}$, then functionally there will
			be no difference between inputting lists or sets.
			
			In summary: @TO2{List, "lists"}@ are used for elements in M, and 
			given as sublists of M&#95;*, while @TO2{Set, "sets"}@ are used for 
			indices, and given as subsets of M.groundSet.
			
		Example
			M = matroid({a,b,c,d},{{a,b},{a,c}})
			peek M
			M.groundSet
			M_*
			bases M
			(bases M)#0
			circuits M
			flats M
			loops M
			coloops M
		Text
			
			Note in particular the types of the various outputs above.
			
			The following illustrates how to perform operations with a specified
			subset of M.groundSet. In the final example, a list of indices is given, 
			which goes against the conventions above, but the elements of the 
			list are treated (correctly) as indices, and if debugLevel is greater
			than 0, then a warning is printed.
			
		Example
			N1 = M | {a,c,d}
			N2 = M | set{0,2,3}
			N1 == N2
			debugLevel = 1
			N3 = M | {0,2,3} -- gives a warning, but attempts to treat 0 as an index
			N3 == N2

	Description
		Text
			This method has two typical-use cases. The first case is
			to convert sublists of a list E to their corresponding indices. 
			For technical reasons, the accepted input is a list L of 
			sublists of E, and the output is a list of sets of indices, 
			one set for each sublist in L. Note that the order of elements
			in the sublist is lost, when viewed as a set.
			
		Example
			indicesOf(toList(a..z) | toList(0..9), {{m,a,c,a,u,l,a,y,2},{i,s},{f,u,n}})
		Text
		
			The second case is with a matroid as input. Here the ambient 
			list E is taken as the ground set of the matroid (i.e. E = M&#95;*),
			and L should be a list of elements of M (not a list of lists); 
			in this case the inverse of this method is given by 
			@TO2{(symbol _, Matroid, List), "taking subscripts"}@
			with respect to M.
			
		Example
			M = matroid({a,b,c,d},{{a,b},{a,c}})
			B = {a, c}
			S = indicesOf(M, B)
			M_S == B
		Text
			
			In this case, if L is not a sublist of M&#95;*, then a warning is 
			printed, and L itself is returned. This is done so that if a user 
			inputs a list of indices, then it will be interpreted as a set of 
			indices. For more on this, cf. @TO groundSet@.

			complex of M corresponds uniquely to a squarefree monomial ideal, 
			which is the output of this method. 
			
			The minimal generators of the ideal correspond to minimal 
			non-faces of the simplicial complex. As the faces of the independence
			complex are precisely the independent sets, the minimal non-faces
			are exactly the minimal dependent sets, i.e. the @TO circuits@ of M.
			
			The facets of the simplicial complex correspond to @TO bases@ of M,
			and thus also to irreducible components of the ideal of M; which 
			are in bijection with the minimal generators of the Alexander dual 
			ideal via taking complements.
			
			Internally, the ideal of the matroid is a fundamental complete 
			invariant, and is heavily used in many algorithms in this package.
			Accordingly, once the ideal of a matroid is computed, it is cached in 
			the @TO CacheTable@ of the matroid, which speeds up any 
			algorithm which requires the ideal as part of the input.

		Text
			The dual matroid of a matroid M has the same ground set

			Duality is a fundamental operation in matroid theory: 
			for nearly any property/operation of matroids, there
			is a corresponding dual version, usually denoted with the
			prefix "co-". For instance, coloops are loops of the dual,
			and contraction is dual to deletion.
			
			In this package, every dual matroid is created as a 
			matroid-dual matroid pair, and each is cached as the dual
			of the other. Often the ideal of the dual matroid has a 
			significantly different number of generators, so many

			The minor M / X &#92; Y of M is given by contracting X and

			of the order in which deletion and contraction is done. If 
			X (or Y) is a set (of indices in M.groundSet), then X is identified 
			with the sublist of elements of M with indices in X: 
			cf. @TO groundSet@ for more on this package-wide convention.

			M = matroid random(ZZ^3,ZZ^6)
			M_*

			(X, Y) = (set{3}, set{0,1})
			(X1, Y1) = (M_X, M_Y)
			N = minor(M, X, Y)

			N == minor(M, X1, Y1)
		Text	
			
			Note that there is potential ambiguity for the second argument - 
			namely, whether or not Y is treated with respect to the ground set 
			of M or M / X (which are different). This method assumes that the 
			indices of Y (and X) are taken with respect to the ground set of M. 
			
			If one already has the indices Y0 of Y in M / X (or the indices X0 of 
			X in M &#92; Y), one can simply use the notation M 
			@TO2{contraction, "/"}@ X @TO2{deletion, "\\"}@ Y0 
			(or (M &#92; Y) / X0). Thus this method serves purely as a 
			convenience, to save the user the (trivial) task of computing Y0 from Y.
			
			If X and Y are not disjoint, then an error is thrown (thus one should
			@TO2{(symbol -, Set, Set), "subtract"}@ X from Y beforehand).

			M5 = matroid completeGraph 5
			M5.groundSet
			N = minor(M5, set{8}, set{3,4,9})

			Matroid union is an important operation in combinatorial optimization,
			and via duality, is related to the problem of matroid intersection.
			
			With the operation of union, one can work with transversal
			matroids and gammoids. A matroid is transversal iff it is a union of 
			rank 1 matroids; strict gammoids are precisely the duals of transversal 
			matroids, and gammoids are restrictions of strict gammoids. In general 
			the problem of determining if a given matroid is a gammoid is difficult.
			
			A union of two uniform matroids is again uniform, but a union 
			of two graphic matroids need not be binary:
			
		Example
			M0 = matroid({a,b,c,d}, {{a},{b},{c}})
			M1 = matroid({a,b,c,d}, {{b},{c},{d}})
			M0 + M1 == uniformMatroid(2,4)
			F7 = specificMatroid "fano"
			NF = specificMatroid "nonfano"
			all({F7 + NF, F7 + F7, NF + NF}, M -> M == uniformMatroid(6, 7))
		Text
		
			One potential caveat: the ground set of M must not have repeated 
			elements. If this is not the case, the user MUST relabel elements of 
			M so that they become distinct. Of course, this needs to be done
			for both M and N, and one should also keep track of which 
			elements of M and N are meant to be the same after the relabelling 
			(otherwise the entire point of taking unions, as opposed to direct 
			sums, is lost).
			
			In the example below, M contains the vector {1,1} twice. Macaulay2 
			has no way of distinguishing the repeated vectors, so the second 
			occurrence of {1,1} is relabelled to the symbol d (of course,
			if the symbol d also happened to be an element of N, then a different 
			label would have to be chosen).
			
		Example
			A = matrix{{0,1,1,1},{0,0,1,1}}
			M = matroid A
			M_*
			unique M_*
			M0 = matroid(M_{0,1,2} | {d}, bases M)

			The separation is called minimal if either |X| = k or |E - X| = k.
			
			This method computes a k-separation of M, if one exists. 
			If no k-separation of M exists, then @TO null@ is returned.
			
			Efficiency is achieved by using special structure of k-separations:
			if (X, E - X) is a minimal k-separation (and no m-separation with 
			m < k exists) with |X| = k, then X is either an independent cocircuit
			or a coindependent circuit. On the other hand, if (X, E - X)

	Description
		Text
			The Tutte polynomial is an invariant of a matroid that is 
			universal with respect to satisfying a deletion-contraction 
			recurrence. Indeed, one way to define the Tutte polynomial 
			of a matroid is: if $M$ is a matroid consisting of $a$ loops 
			and $b$ coloops, then T_M(x, y) = x^ay^b, and if 
			$e \in&nbsp;M$ is neither a loop nor a coloop, then 
			T_M(x, y) := T_{M/e}(x, y) + T_{M&#92;e}(x, y), where 
			M&#92;e is the @TO deletion@ of M with respect to \{e\},
			and M/e is the @TO contraction@ of M with respect to 
			\{e\}. Many invariants of a matroid can be determined by 
			substituting values into its Tutte polynomial - cf.
			@TO tutteEvaluate@.

			The chromatic polynomial is an invariant of a graph

			of ways to color the vertices of G using at most n colors, 
			such that no adjacent vertices have the same color. 

			This method computes the chromatic polynomial as a 
			multiple of the characteristic polynomial of the graphic 
			matroid. Indeed, if M = M(G) is the graphic matroid 
			corresponding to a graph G, then the chromatic 
			polynomial of G equals the characteristic polynomial of 
			M times x^k, where k is the number of connected

			For a matroid M on ground set E, a weight function on M is

			adding elements of E of maximum weight, which together with 
			the elements already added, form an independent set.

			In this method, a weight function is specified by its list of values 
			on E. Thus if $E = \{e_1, ..., e_n\}$, then w is represented as the 
			list $\{w(e_1), ..., w(e_n)\}$.

			Matroids can be characterized via the greedy algorithm as follows: 
			a set $\mathcal{I}$ of subsets of E is the set of independent sets 
			of a matroid on E iff $\mathcal{I}$ is nonempty, downward closed, 
			and for every weight function $w : E -> \mathbb{R}$, the greedy

		Text
			This documentation page contains various tips for 
			effectively working with Chow rings of matroids within
			this package. We take the graphic matroid of the 
			complete graph on 4 vertices as the running example:
			
		Example
			M = matroid completeGraph 4
			I = idealChowRing M;
		Text
		
			As seen from above, the output of @TO idealChowRing@
			is an @TO Ideal@, rather than a @TO Ring@. One can
			get the ambient polynomial ring, as well as the associated
			quotient ring:
			
		Example
			R = ring I
			S = R/I
		Text
		
			Next, one often wants to access and perform computations
			with elements in the quotient ring. The variables in the 
			ambient ring of the ideal of the Chow ring are indexed by 
			flats of the matroid, which retains useful information but 
			makes the variables themselves difficult to access. However,
			as with any ring in Macaulay2, one can always access variables
			using subscripts:
			-- using @TO2{(symbol _, Ring, ZZ), "subscripts"}@:
			
		Example
			R_0
			S_1
			S_5*S_6
		Text
			
			Notice that elements of $S$ are already rewritten in the 
			normal form modulo the ideal of the Chow ring. 
			
			One can access the flat corresponding to a given variable as follows:
			
		Example
			R_7
			last baseName R_7
		Text
		
			It is also possible to access variables via their flats by creating an 
			auxiliary @TO HashTable@:
