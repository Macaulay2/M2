            The unique monotone triangle $T=(T_0,\ldots,T_n)$ corresponding to $A$ has the property that $T_m$ is the (ordered) set of column indices in which $\sum_{i=1}^m A_m $ 
	    has an entry of $1$, where $A_m$ denotes the $m$th row of $A$.
            See [HR] for more details.

    Description
        Text
            Converts an monotone triangle to an alternating sign matrix (ASM) according to the bijection described in [HR].
            More precisely, suppose $T=(T_0,\ldots,T_n)$ is a monotone triangle.
            The unique ASM $A$ corresponding to $T$ is given by $A_m = \mathbb{1}_{T_m} - \mathbb{1}_{T_{m-1}}$, where $A_m$ denotes the $m$th row of $A$ and $\mathbb{1}_{T_i}$
	    is the is a vector of length $n$ whose entries are $1$ in the positions whose indices appear in $T_i$ and $0$ otherwise.
            See [HR] for more details.
	    
	    This function does not check that what you've given it is actually a monotone triangle before attempting to convert to an ASM.
