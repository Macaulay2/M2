    A package for finding canonical subalgebra bases (Sagbi bases)
  Description
    Text
      Let $R=k[f_1,\ldots,f_k]$ denote the subalgebra of the polynomial ring $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ generated by $f_1,\ldots ,f_k.$ We say
      $f_1,\ldots,f_k$ form a {\it subalgebra basis} with respect to a monomial order $<$ if the {\it initial algebra}
      associated to $<$, defined as $in(R) := k[in(f) \mid f \in R],$ is generated by the elements
      $in(f_1), \ldots , in(f_k).$ 
      The main functions provided by this package are for computing these subalgebra bases: @TO sagbi @, @TO subalgebraBasis@, and @TO subduction @.
      Some useful functions for internal use and experimental features are also provided.

        Partial subalgebra bases are unavoidable since a subalgebra of a polynomial ring, endowed with some polynomial order, need not have a finite subalgebra basis.  Here is a quintessential example of this phenomenon:
    Example
      R=QQ[x,y];
      A = subring matrix{{x+y,x*y,x*y^2}};
      gens sagbi(A,Limit=>3)
      gens sagbi(A,Limit=>10)
    Text
        Nevertheless, a finite subalgebra basis can be computed in many cases.

	  The paper "Using SAGBI bases to compute invariants" by Stillman and Tsai (1990) describes algorithms for computing Sagbi bases of subrings contained in quotient rings.
	  The following code demonstrates Example 2 from that paper (in the case $N=4$.)
	CannedExample
	  N = 4;
	  gndR = QQ[(a,b,c,d)|(u_1..u_N)|(v_1..v_N), MonomialOrder => Lex];

        Text
	  In general, when a finite SAGBI basis does happen to exist, the algorithm *should* be able to calculate it correctly given enough
	  time.
	  However, there are some peculiarities in the case of quotient rings, such as ``false termination" Example 1 from the same paper:
	Example
	  gndR = QQ[x,y, MonomialOrder => Lex];
	  I = ideal(x^2 - x*y);
	  Q = gndR/I;
	  subR = sagbi subring {x};

	  Although the initial algebra in this example is infinitely generated, new generators are not generated as expected from S-pairs.

	   The function @TO "mingensSubring"@ works by converting the given matrix (which should be thought of as a module) to an

	        @TT "p_0"@, ..., @TT "p_9"@ are the variables of what is referred to in the code as the @TT "tensorRing"@,
            which has two types of variables: The variables corresponding to the variables in the @TO "ambient"@ ring (@TT "p_0"@,...,@TT "p_2"@ in this example) and the variables corresponding to the generators of the @TO "Subring"@ (@TT "p_3"@,...,@TT "p_9"@ in this example).
	  
	        The function @TO "moduleToSubringIdeal"@ converts the toric syzygy module from our example (which is returned by @TO "toricSyz"@ in the form of a matrix) to an ideal

	        The ambient ring of @TT "modRing"@ is the tensor ring of @TT "subR"@, except two new variables @TT "p_10"@ and @TT "p_11"@ have been added.
	        The variables @TT "p_10"@ and @TT "p_11"@ correspond to the generators of the module. The generators @TT "p_12"@ and @TT "p_13"@ also correspond
	        to the generators of the module.
	  
            The primary reason why this implementation should be considered experimental is that the monomial order of a module is not fully specified:
            When a @TO "Subring"@ instance is created using the function @TO "subring"@, the monomial order of the ambient variables is the same as the monomial
	        order of their corresponding variables in the ambient ring while the monomial order of the variables corresponding to generators is assigned arbitrarily. The problem with this system is
	        that it is likely to cause bugs in the case where a subring's ambient ring is the tensor ring of another subring.

       Converts elements of a subring ideal (represented by a one-column matrix and usually generated by @TO "moduleToSubringIdeal"@) to elements
       of a module (represented by a matrix).

       Internally, the argument gVars is sorted so that the order of the columns of the resulting
       matrix are consistent.
       
     Example 
       R = QQ[a, b, c, x_1, x_2, x_3];
       extractEntries(matrix {{a*x_1 + b*x_2 + c*x_3}}, matrix {{x_1, x_2, x_3}})
       extractEntries(matrix {{a*x_1 + b*x_2 + c*x_3},{a*x_1 + a*x_2 + a*x_3}}, matrix {{x_1, x_2, x_3}} )

     [subring, VarBaseName]
   Headline
     Constructs a subring of a polynomial ring.
   Usage
     A = subring M
     A = subring L
     A = subring S
   Inputs
     M:Matrix
       a one-row matrix whose entries are the generators for the constructed @TO "Subring"@.
     L:List 
       a list of generators for the constructed @TO "Subring"@.
     S:SAGBIBasis
     VarBaseName=>String
       determines the symbol used for the variables of the @TT "tensorRing"@ for the constructed @TO "Subring"@.
   Outputs
     A:Subring
   Description
     Text
       This function serves as the canonical constructor for the @TO "Subring"@ type.

       Generators that are constants are ignored because all subrings are assumed to contain the field of coefficients. An error is 
       thrown if the given set of generators does not contain at least one non-constant generator.  The generators of a subring need not be reduced.
     Example
       gndR = QQ[x];
       A = subring {x^4+x^3, x^2+x}
       subring sagbi A
       (x^3+x^2)%A

   Usage
     B = sagbiBasis S
   Inputs
     S:Subring
     storePending => Boolean
        determines if the pending list (which may be large) is stored internally at the end of a computation.

        name to be used internally for variables in the tensor ring.
   Outputs

   Description

   Usage

        Performs subduction of the @TO "RingElement"@ or the entries of the @TO "Matrix"@ by the content of the @TO "PresRing"@.
