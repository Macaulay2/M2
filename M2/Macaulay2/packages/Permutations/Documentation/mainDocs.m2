    the Permutation type
  Description
    Text
      Permutations are constructed from lists. To create a permutation, 
      use the {\tt permutation} method.
    Example
      p = permutation {3,1,2,4,5}
    Text
      Permutations must be constructed from lists consisting of only the integers
      $1 \dots n$. If a list contains any other elements or does not consist of 
      the entire range, then an error is thrown.

      1. each cycle is listed with its largest element first, and @BR{}@
