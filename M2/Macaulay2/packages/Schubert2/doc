    computation in intersection theory
  Description
    Text
      This package supports computation in intersection theory
      on smooth varieties.  An @TO2{AbstractVariety,"abstract variety"}@ is not given by equations.
      Instead, one gives its intersection ring (usually modulo numerical equivalence),
      its dimension, the Chern class of its tangent bundle, and a method for
      computing integrals.  An @TO2{AbstractSheaf,"abstract sheaf"}@ on an abstract variety is represented
      by its total Chern class (or by its Chern
      character).  An @TO2{AbstractVarietyMap,"abstract variety map"}@ is a map between abstract
      varieties: the information encoded is the pull-back and push-forward
      maps between the corresponding intersection rings.

  Description
   Text
	There are d+1 conditions for a line to be
	contained in a general hypersurface of degree d in $\PP^n$.
	The Grassmannian of lines in $\PP^n$ has dimension 2(n-1).  Therefore,
	when d+1 = 2(n-1), we should expect a finite number of lines.
	Here is a way of computing the number using {\em Schubert2}.  In the case
	of lines on a quintic hypersurface in $\PP^4$, this computation was done
	by Hermann Schubert in 1879.

	We will first illustrate the method by computing the number
	of lines on a cubic surface in $\PP^3$.

	We first construct @ofClass AbstractVariety@ representing
	the Grassmannian of lines in $\PP^3$ and then retrieve its tautological sub-
	and quotient bundles.
   Example
     G = flagBundle({2,2}, VariableNames => {,c})
     (S,Q) = G.Bundles
   Text
	Any cubic surface is given by a cubic form on $\PP^3$,
	that is, an element of the third symmetric power of the
	space of linear forms, which is the trivial rank 4 bundle
	on $\PP^3$.  Its image in the third symmetric power $Symm^3 Q$  of the
	quotient bundle $Q$ vanishes at those points of the
	Grassmannian that correspond to lines on which the
	cubic form vanishes identically, that is, lines
	contained in the cubic surface.  The class of this
	locus is the top Chern class of this bundle.
   Example
	B = symmetricPower(3,Q)
	c = chern(rank B,B)
	integral c
   Text
	We can do the same thing for any n, (with d = 2n-3) as
	follows:
   Example
	f = n -> (
	     G := flagBundle({n-1,2});
	     integral chern symmetricPower_(2*n-3) last G.Bundles
	     )
	for n from 2 to 8 list time f n
	time f 20
   Text
	Note: in characteristic zero, using Bertini's theorem,
	the numbers computed can be proved to be equal
	to the actual numbers of distinct lines 
	for general hypersurfaces.  In $\PP^3$, every smooth cubic
	surface in characteristic zero has exactly 27 lines.
	In higher dimensions there may be smooth hypersurfaces for which
	the number of lines is different from the ``expected'' number
	that we have computed above.
	For example, the Fermat quintic threefold has an infinite number
	of lines on it.

     The number of conics (rational curves of degree 2) on a general
     quintic hypersurface in $\PP^4$ was computed by S. Katz in 1985.  Here
     is how the computation can be made with {\em Schubert2}.

     Any conic in $\PP^4$ spans a unique plane, and the conics in a plane correspond to the points
     of $\PP^5$.  Hence the space of conics in
     $\PP^4$ is a certain $\PP^5$-bundle $X$ over the Grassmannian $G$ of planes in $\PP^4$.
   Example
     G = flagBundle{2,3}
   Text
     We extract the rank 2 tautological subbundle $S$ and the rank 3 tautological quotient bundle $Q$:
   Example
     (S,Q) = G.Bundles
   Text
     We form the bundle of quadratic forms on the variable planes:
   Example
     B = symmetricPower(2,Q)
   Text
     As a matter of convention, a {\em projective bundle} constructed by the function @ TO projectiveBundle @
     in {\em Schubert2} parametrizes 
     rank 1 {\em quotients} of the sheaf provided.  The $\PP^5$-bundle of conics is given by sublinebundles of $B$, or
     equivalently, by rank 1 quotients of the dual, $B^*$, as in the following code:
   Example  
     X = projectiveBundle(dual B, VariableNames => {,{z}})
   Text
     The equation of the general quintic is a section of the fifth symmetric
     power of the space of linear forms on $\PP^4$.  The induced equation on any given
     conic is an element in the corresponding closed fiber of a certain vector
     bundle $A$ of rank 11 on the parameter space $X$.  On any given plane $P$,
     and for any conic $C$ in $P$, we get the following exact sequence:
	   $$ 0 \to{} H^0(O_P(3)) \to{} H^0(O_P(5)) \to{} H^0(O_C(5)) \to{} 0$$
     As $C$ varies, these sequences glue to a short exact sequence of bundles on $X$:
	   $$ 0 \to{} Symm^3 Q \otimes O(-z) \to{} Symm^5 Q \to{} A \to{} 0$$
     We compute the class of $A$ in the Grothendieck group:
   Example
     A = symmetricPower_5 Q - symmetricPower_3 Q ** OO(-z)
   Text
     A given conic is contained in the quintic if and only if the equation of the
     quintic vanishes identically on the conic.  Hence the class of the locus of
     conics contained in the quintic is the top Chern class of $A$.  Hence
     the number of them is the integral of this Chern class:
   Example
     integral chern A

    the class of all abstract varieties
  Description
   Text
     An abstract variety in {\em Schubert2} 
     is defined by its dimension and by a $\QQ$-algebra $A$, interpreted as the intersection ring.
     For example, the following code defines the abstract variety corresponding to $\PP^2$. 
   Example
     A=QQ[t]/ideal(t^3)
     X=abstractVariety(2,A)
   Text
     Once the variety $X$ is created, we can access its structure
     sheaf $O_X$ via the operator {\tt OO}, and view its Chern class:
   Example
     OO_X
     chern OO_X
   Text
     A variable of type @ TO AbstractVariety @ is implemented as @ ofClass MutableHashTable @, and can
     contain other information, such as the variety's tangent bundle, stored under the key @ TO TangentBundle @.
     Installation of a variety's tangent bundle enables the computation of its Todd class.
   Example
	X.TangentBundle  = abstractSheaf(X,Rank=>2, ChernClass=>(1+t)^3)
	todd X
   Text
     To enable the computation of such things as the Euler characteristic of a
     sheaf, we must also specify a method to take the @TO integral@ of an
     element of the intersection ring $A$; in the case where $A$ is Gorenstein,
     as is the case for the intersection ring modulo numerical equivalence of a
     complete nonsingular variety, the integral can often be implemented as the
     functional that takes the coefficient of the highest degree component with
     respect to a suitable basis of monomials.
   Example
     integral A := f -> coefficient(t^2,f);
   Text
     Now we can compute the Euler characteristic of the line bundle whose first Chern class 
     is $2t$; the algorithm uses the Todd class and the Riemann-Roch formula:
   Example
     chi OO_X(2*t)
   Text
      There are several other methods for constructing abstract varieties: the following functions
      construct basic useful varieties:
      @TO projectiveSpace@,
      @TO projectiveBundle@,
      @TO flagBundle@, and
      @TO base@.

    the class of all abstract sheaves
  Description
   Text
     A virtual {\em abstract sheaf} over @ofClass AbstractVariety@ $X$ is specified by giving its rank and its total Chern class,
     as an element of the intersection ring of $X$.

     For example, the Horrocks-Mumford bundle on projective 4-space
     can be constructed with the following code.  We first produce a base point
     whose intersection ring contains a variable named {\tt n}, in 
     terms of which we can compute the Hilbert polynomial.
   Example
     pt = base(n)
   Text
     Then we create the projective space of dimension 4 over the base point, 
     using the {\tt VariableName} option to specify that $h$ is the variable to use to represent the first
     Chern class of the tautological quotient line bundle on the projective space.
   Example
    X = projectiveSpace(4,pt,VariableName => h)
   Text
     Now we create an abstract sheaf of rank 2 with $1 + 5 h + 10 h^2$ as its total Chern class.
   Example
     F = abstractSheaf(X, Rank => 2, ChernClass => 1 + 5*h + 10*h^2)
   Text
     Its class is @ TO AbstractSheaf @:
   Example
     class F
   Text
     Now we compute the Hilbert polynomial of $F$.

    chi F(n*h)
