    computation in intersection theory
  Description
    Text

      This package supports computation in intersection theory on smooth projective varieties.  An @TO2{AbstractVariety,"abstract
      variety"}@ is not given by equations.  Instead, one gives its graded intersection ring of algebraic cycle classes
      modulo numerical equivalence (tensored with the rational numbers or perhaps
      with some algebra over the rational numbers), its dimension, a method for counting the number of points in a cycle class
      of dimension zero (integration), and the Chern class of its tangent bundle (if
      known).  The intersection ring is represented as a {\em Macaulay2} @ TO2{Ring,"ring"} @, and its elements are {\em
      Macaulay2} @ TO2{RingElement,"ring elements"} @.
      
      An @TO2{AbstractSheaf,"abstract sheaf"}@ on an abstract variety is represented by an object of class 
      @ TO AbstractSheaf @ that contains the total Chern character of the sheaf.  It should be thought of as an element of
      the Grothendieck ring of the variety tensored with the rational numbers, which, by the
      Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, is isomorphic to the intersection ring; the isomorphism is provided
      by the Chern character.

      An @TO2{AbstractVarietyMap,"abstract variety map"}@ is a map between abstract varieties: the information encoded
      is the pull-back and push-forward maps between the corresponding intersection rings.  If necessary, the push-forward map
      is computed automatically from multiplication and integrals.

      One may start with a {\em base variety} whose intersection ring contains variables of degree 0 that can represent
      unknown integers in formulas, along with variables of positive degree that can be used as Chern classes of
      generic abstract sheaves.

      This package is inspired by @ HREF{"http://stromme.uib.no/home/schubert/", "schubert"} @, which was written by
      @ HREF{"http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~katz/", "Sheldon Katz"} @ and @ HREF{"http://stromme.uib.no/", "Stein A. StrÃ¸mme"} @.

      The theory behind the computations of intersection rings of flag bundles has been made rigorous in the paper 
      {\em Computations in intersection rings of flag bundles} by Grayson, Seceleanu, and Stillman:
      see @ HREF {"http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4190","arXiv:1205.4190"} @.  The paper also treats the case
      of isotropic flag bundles, with the corresponding algorithms appearing here for the first time.

  Description
   Text
	There are d+1 conditions for a line to be
	contained in a general hypersurface of degree d in $\PP^n$.
	The Grassmannian of lines in $\PP^n$ has dimension 2(n-1).  Therefore,
	when d+1 = 2(n-1), we should expect a finite number of lines.
	Here is a way of computing the number using {\em Schubert2}.  In the case
	of lines on a quintic hypersurface in $\PP^4$, this computation was done
	by Hermann Schubert in 1879.

	We will first illustrate the method by computing the number
	of lines on a cubic surface in $\PP^3$.

	We first construct @ofClass AbstractVariety@ representing
	the Grassmannian of lines in $\PP^3$ and then retrieve its tautological sub-
	and quotient bundles.
   Example
     G = flagBundle({2,2}, VariableNames => {,c})
     (S,Q) = bundles G
   Text
	Any cubic surface is given by a cubic form on $\PP^3$,
	that is, an element of the third symmetric power of the
	space of linear forms, which is the trivial rank 4 bundle
	on $\PP^3$.  Its image in the third symmetric power $Symm^3 Q$  of the
	quotient bundle $Q$ vanishes at those points of the
	Grassmannian that correspond to lines on which the
	cubic form vanishes identically, that is, lines
	contained in the cubic surface.  The class of this
	locus is the top Chern class of this bundle.
   Example
	B = symmetricPower(3,Q)
	c = chern(rank B,B)
	integral c
   Text
	We can do the same thing for any n, (with d = 2n-3) as
	follows:
   Example
	f = n -> (
	     G := flagBundle({n-1,2});
	     integral chern symmetricPower_(2*n-3) last bundles G
	     )
	for n from 2 to 10 list time f n
   Text
	Note: in characteristic zero, using Bertini's theorem,
	the numbers computed can be proved to be equal
	to the actual numbers of distinct lines 
	for general hypersurfaces.  In $\PP^3$, every smooth cubic
	surface in characteristic zero has exactly 27 lines.
	In higher dimensions there may be smooth hypersurfaces for which
	the number of lines is different from the ``expected'' number
	that we have computed above.
	For example, the Fermat quintic threefold has an infinite number
	of lines on it.

  Description
   Text
     The number of conics (rational curves of degree 2) on a general
     quintic hypersurface in $\PP^4$ was computed by S. Katz in 1985.  Here
     is how the computation can be made with {\em Schubert2}.

     Any conic in $\PP^4$ spans a unique plane, and the conics in a plane correspond to the points
     of $\PP^5$.  Hence the space of conics in
     $\PP^4$ is a certain $\PP^5$-bundle $X$ over the Grassmannian $G$ of planes in $\PP^4$.
   Example
     G = flagBundle{2,3}
   Text
     We extract the rank 2 tautological subbundle $S$ and the rank 3 tautological quotient bundle $Q$:
   Example
     (S,Q) = bundles G
   Text
     We form the bundle of quadratic forms on the variable planes:
   Example
     B = symmetricPower(2,Q)
   Text
     As a matter of convention, a {\em projective bundle} constructed by the function @ TO projectiveBundle' @
     in {\em Schubert2} parametrizes 
     rank 1 {\em quotients} of the sheaf provided.  The $\PP^5$-bundle of conics is given by sublinebundles of $B$, or
     equivalently, by rank 1 quotients of the dual, $B^*$, as in the following code:
   Example  
     X = projectiveBundle'(dual B, VariableNames => {,{z}})
   Text
     The equation of the general quintic is a section of the fifth symmetric
     power of the space of linear forms on $\PP^4$.  The induced equation on any given
     conic is an element in the corresponding closed fiber of a certain vector
     bundle $A$ of rank 11 on the parameter space $X$.  On any given plane $P$,
     and for any conic $C$ in $P$, we get the following exact sequence:
	   $$ 0 \to{} H^0(O_P(3)) \to{} H^0(O_P(5)) \to{} H^0(O_C(5)) \to{} 0$$
     As $C$ varies, these sequences glue to a short exact sequence of bundles on $X$:
	   $$ 0 \to{} Symm^3 Q \otimes O(-z) \to{} Symm^5 Q \to{} A \to{} 0$$
     We compute the class of $A$ in the Grothendieck group:
   Example
     A = symmetricPower_5 Q - symmetricPower_3 Q ** OO(-z)
   Text
     A given conic is contained in the quintic if and only if the equation of the
     quintic vanishes identically on the conic.  Hence the class of the locus of
     conics contained in the quintic is the top Chern class of $A$.  Hence
     the number of them is the integral of this Chern class:
   Example
     integral chern A

    "A cubic fourfold containing a degree-5 del Pezzo surface"       
  Headline
    an example
  Description
    Text
      A smooth cubic fourfold {\tt Y} containing a degree-5 del Pezzo surface {\tt X} is known to be rational, see for example S. L. Tregub's "Three constructions of rationality of a four-dimensional cubic", 1984.  If {\tt H} is the hyperplane class on {\tt Y}, then {\tt 2H - X} is a linear series which gives a birational map from {\tt Y} to \mathbb{P}^4.  We will reproduce the numerical calculations which suggest (but do not prove) this fact.  We start by building part of the Chow ring of {\tt Y}:
    Example
      p = base(r,s)
      P5 = projectiveBundle(5,p)
      Y = sectionZeroLocus OO_P5(3) -- cubic fourfold
      x = chern(1,OO_Y(1)) -- hyperplane class
    Text
      We then build the Chow ring of the degree-5 del Pezzo:
    Example
      S = intersectionRing p -- important that we use the same base ring
      B1 = S[e_1..e_4,h, Join => false]
      I1 = (ideal vars B1)^3 -- relations imposed by dimension
      I2 = ideal flatten (for i from 0 to 4 list (for j from i+1 to 4 list (B1_i * B1_j))) -- relations imposed by non-intersection
      I3 = ideal for i from 1 to 4 list (e_i^2 + h^2) -- relations that make each exceptional divisor a (-1)-curve
      I = trim (I1 + I2 + I3)
      B = B1/I
      integral B := b -> coefficient((B_4)^2, b)
    Text
      We build the canonical class and tangent class of {\tt X}:
    Example
      K = -(3*h - e_1 - e_2 - e_3 - e_4)
      tX = 1 - K + 7*h^2
    Text
      The pullback map from {\tt Y} to {\tt X} takes the hyperplane class to the anticanonical class on {\tt X}.  Because a @ TO projectiveBundle @ has extra generators, we end up also having to say where powers of the hyperplane class map to:
    Example
      A = intersectionRing Y
      f = map(B, A, {K, -K, K^2, -K^3, K^4, -K^5})
    Text
      Now we build the @ TO inclusion @ of {\tt X} in {\tt Y}, which assembles the above information into a variety:
    Example
      i = inclusion(f,
         SubTangent => tX,
         SubDimension => 2,
         Base => p)
      X = source i
      Z = target i
    Text
      We blow up this inclusion so that we can work with the linear series {\tt 2H - X} as a divisor.
    Example
      (Ztilde, PN, PNmap, Zmap) = blowup(i)
    Text
      And now we calculate the Euler characteristic and degree of the line bundle {\tt 2H - E} on {\tt Ztilde}.
    Example
      AZtilde = intersectionRing Ztilde
      exc = chern(1,exceptionalDivisor Ztilde) -- exceptional class
      EBA = intersectionRing Z
      hyp = Zmap^* promote(x, EBA) -- hyperplane class of Ztilde
      L = OO_Ztilde(2*hyp - exc)
      chi L
      integral ((chern(1,L))^4)
    Text
      More generally, we can compute the Euler characteristic and degree of all line bundles of the form {\tt rH + sE} on {\tt Ztilde}:
    Example
      (r', s') = ((r_A, s_A) / (elt ->  promote(elt, EBA))) / Zmap^*
      L = OO_Ztilde(r' * hyp + s' * exc)
      chi L
      integral ((chern(1,L))^4)

    AbstractVariety
  Headline
    the class of all abstract varieties
  Description
   Text
     An abstract variety in {\em Schubert2} 
     is defined by its dimension and by a $\QQ$-algebra $A$, interpreted as the intersection ring.
     For example, the following code defines the abstract variety corresponding to $\PP^2$. 
   Example
     A=QQ[t]/ideal(t^3)
     X=abstractVariety(2,A)
   Text
     Once the variety $X$ is created, we can access its structure
     sheaf $O_X$ via the operator {\tt OO}, and view its Chern class:
   Example
     OO_X
     chern OO_X
   Text
     A variable of type @ TO AbstractVariety @ is implemented as @ ofClass MutableHashTable @, and can
     contain other information, such as the variety's tangent bundle, stored under the key @ TO TangentBundle @.
     Installation of a variety's tangent bundle enables the computation of its Todd class.
   Example
	X.TangentBundle  = abstractSheaf(X,Rank=>2, ChernClass=>(1+t)^3)
	todd X
   Text
     To enable the computation of such things as the Euler characteristic of a
     sheaf, we must also specify a method to take the @TO integral@ of an
     element of the intersection ring $A$; in the case where $A$ is Gorenstein,
     as is the case for the intersection ring modulo numerical equivalence of a
     complete nonsingular variety, the integral can often be implemented as the
     functional that takes the coefficient of the highest degree component with
     respect to a suitable basis of monomials.  The default integration method
     installed by such functions as @ TO base @ and @ TO abstractVariety @ for varieties
     of dimension greater than 0 returns
     a symbolic expression indicating the further integration that ought to be done.
     In this example, we choose to implement the integral by taking the coefficient of the
     monomoial in our ring of top degree.
   Example
     integral A := f -> coefficient(t^2,f);
   Text
     Now we can compute the Euler characteristic of the line bundle whose first Chern class 
     is $2t$ (the algorithm uses the Todd class and the Riemann-Roch formula):
   Example
     chi OO_X(2*t)
   Text
      There are several other methods for constructing abstract varieties: the following functions
      construct basic useful varieties:
      @TO abstractProjectiveSpace@,
      @TO projectiveBundle@,
      @TO flagBundle@, and
      @TO base@.

  Description
   Text
     The Horrocks-Mumford bundle on projective 4-space
     can be constructed with the following code.  We first produce a base point
     whose intersection ring contains a variable named {\tt n}, in 
     terms of which we can compute the Hilbert polynomial.
   Example
     pt = base(n)
   Text
     Then we create the projective space of dimension 4 over the base point.
   Example
    X = abstractProjectiveSpace'_4 pt
   Text
    Note that we use @TO abstractProjectiveSpace'@ to get Grothendieck-style notation.  This has the advantage that
    the first Chern class of the tautological line bundle is assigned to the variable {\tt h}:
   Example
     chern_1 OO_X(1)
   Text
     Now we create an abstract sheaf of rank 2 with $1 + 5 h + 10 h^2$ as its total Chern class:
   Example
     F = abstractSheaf(X, Rank => 2, ChernClass => 1 + 5*h + 10*h^2)
   Text
    Alternatively, we can use the representation of the Horrocks-Mumford bundle as the cohomology of the monad
    $$0 \rightarrow{} O_X(-1)^5 \rightarrow{} \Omega_X^2(2)^2 \rightarrow{} O_X^5 \rightarrow{} 0$$
    to produce a construction:
   Example
    F' = 2 * (exteriorPower_2 cotangentBundle X)(2) - 5 * OO_X(-1) - 5 * OO_X
    chern F'
    rank F'
   Text
    Here is the relationship between the two bundles:
   Example
    F === dual F'(-2)
   Text
     Now we compute the Hilbert polynomial of $F$.  This computation makes use of the Riemann-Roch Theorem.
   Example
    chi F(n*h)

     F:FlagBundle
       associated to a vector bundle $A$, say, of rank $n$.

       the appropriate {\em Schubert class} or {\em Schubert variety}, depending on the the type of {\tt s}.  See 
       page 271 of Fulton's book, {\em Intersection Theory} for the notation for @TO schubertCycle@, of which this
       is the dual.

       In the case where {\tt s} is a @ ofClass Sequence @, the value returned is the {\em homology} class of the {\em Schubert variety} in
       $ F $ consisting of those points corresponding to $(q-1)$-planes of $\PP(A)$ that meet $ W_j $ in dimension at least
       $ i $ with $0 \le{} i < q$, for each $ i $, where $ j = s_i $, and where $ W_j $ is the projective subspace of dimension
       $ j $ in a fixed (complete) flag $0 = W_0 \subset{} W_1 \subset{} ... \subset{} W_{n-1} = \PP(A) $.  Here $ \PP(A) $ denotes

       see @ TO schubertCycle @.        
       
       In the case where {\tt s} is a @ ofClass List @, the result is the corresponding {\em Schubert class} in
       cohomology.  In {\em Schubert2} homology and cohomology are identified with each other.
       Given a sequence $(s_0, ..., s_{q-1})$, one can convert it to a list yielding the same Schubert
       class by the formula $ \{..., n-q+i-s_i, ...\} $.
       
       This is related to @TO schubertCycle@ as follows: if $E'$ is the dual bundle of $A$ and $G' = G(q,A')$ is the dual
       Grassmannian, then {\tt schubertCycle'(s,G)} is carried to {\tt schubertCycle(s,G')} under the duality isomorphism.

   Item
     If the {\tt DefaultPullBack => true} option is set (this is the default setting), then a
     method for pulling back sheaves is installed in the method fUpper.  The default behavior
     is to pull back both Chern classes and Chern characters via the supplied map.

     and if the calculation of sheaf pushforward is possible (i.e. either $X$ and $Y$ have supplied
     tangent bundles and $fUpper$ can pull back sheaves, or the {\tt TangentBundle} option is set),
     method for pulling back sheaves is installed in the method fUpper.  The default behavior is

    ring {\tt n} is in.  By default, the first Chern class of the tautological line bundle on a projective space
    or projective bundle is called {\tt h}, so we may use {\tt OO(h)} as alternative notation for {\tt OO_Y(1)}:

    get the Schubert ring of a Grassmannian
  Usage
    schubertRing G
  Inputs
    G:FlagBundle
      a Grassmannian, with intersection ring $R$, say
  Outputs
    :
      A triple $(S,T,U)$, where $S$ is the Schubert ring of $G$,
      with generators corresponding to the (Fulton-style) Schubert
      cycles of $G$ and with multiplication corresponding to multiplication in the intersection
      ring of $G$, $T$ is the map from $R$ to $S$ converting from the Chern class basis to
      the Schubert basis, and $U$ is the inverse map to $T$.
  Consequences
    Item
      When run for the first time on $G$, the Schubert ring $S$ is built and cached in
      {\tt G.cache.SchubertRing}, see @TO SchubertRing@, $T$ is built and cached in
      {\tt G.cache.htoschubert}, and $U$ is built and cached in {\tt G.cache.schuberttoh}.
