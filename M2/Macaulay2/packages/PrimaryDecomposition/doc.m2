  Description
    Text
      This package provides routines for computation involving components of ideals and modules,
      including associated primes and primary decompositions.

      The following simple example illustrates the use of @TO removeLowestDimension@, @TO topComponents@,
      @TO "MinimalPrimes :: radical"@, @TO "MinimalPrimes :: minimalPrimes"@, @TO associatedPrimes@, and
      @TO primaryDecomposition@.
    Example
      R = ZZ/32003[a..d];
      I = monomialCurveIdeal(R,{1,3,4})
      J = ideal(a^3,b^3,c^3-d^3)
      I = intersect(I,J)

  Description
    Text
      The function @TO associatedPrimes@ returns a list of the associated prime ideals for a given ideal @TT "I"@.
      The associated prime ideals correspond to the irreducible components of the variety associated to @TT "I"@.
      They are useful in many applications in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
      -- For a tutorial about associated prime ideals and primary decomposition, see @TO "commutative algebra"@.
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[a..d];
      I = ideal(a*b-c*d, (a*c-b*d)^2);

  Description
    Text
      @SUBSECTION "Introduction"@

      The function @TO primaryDecomposition@ applied to an ideal @TT "I"@ returns a list of ideals.
      These ideals have two key features, first, their intersection is equal to the ideal @TT "I"@ and
      second the ideals are primary. Therefore these ideals form a primary decomposition of the ideal.
      Since the ideals are primary their corresponding varieties are irreducible. The decomposition
      returned is irredundant, which means that the radicals of the ideals returned are distinct prime
      ideals which are the associated prime ideals for @TT "I"@ (see @TO "associated primes"@).

      @SUBSECTION "An example"@
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[a..d];
      I = ideal(a*b-c*d, (a*c-b*d)^2);
      primaryDecomposition I
    Text
      To obtain the associated prime ideals corresponding to the primary components returned by
      @TT "primaryDecomposition"@ use the function @TO associatedPrimes@.
      Each entry in the list given by @TT "associatedPrimes"@ is the radical of the respective entry
      in the list given by @TT "primary decomposition"@.

  Description
    Text
      This routine returns an irredundant primary decomposition for the ideal @TT "I"@.
      The specific algorithm used varies depending on the characteristics of the ideal,
      and can also be specified using the @TT "Strategy"@ option. In all cases, the radical
      of each entry of the output is equal to the corresponding entry of the output of @TO "associatedPrimes"@.

      Primary decomposition algorithms are very sensitive to the input. Some algorithms work very well on certain
      classes of ideals, but poorly on other classes. If this function seems to be taking too long, try another
      algorithm using @TO [primaryDecomposition, Strategy]@.
    Example
      R = QQ[a..i];
      I = permanents(2,genericMatrix(R,a,3,3))
      C = primaryDecomposition I;
      I == intersect C

      Recall that @TO "Macaulay2Doc :: List / Function"@ applies a function to each element of a
      list, returning the results as a list. This is often useful with lists of ideals,
      such as the list @TT "C"@ of primary components.
    Example
      C / toString / print;
      C / codim
      C / degree
    Text
      The corresponding list of associated prime ideals is cached
      and can be obtained by using @TO (associatedPrimes, Ideal)@.
    Example
      associatedPrimes I / print;

    irredundant primary decomposition of a module
  Usage
    primaryDecomposition M
  Inputs
    M:Module
      in a (quotient of a) polynomial ring @TT "R"@
    MinimalGenerators=>Boolean
      if false, the components will not be minimalized
  Outputs
    :List
      containing a minimal list of primary submodules of @TT "M"@ whose intersection is @TT "0"@
  Description
    Text
      This routine returns a minimal primary decomposition for the zero submodule of @TT "M"@,
      i.e. a minimal list of submodules @TT "Q_i"@ of @TT "M"@ such that the intersection of all
      the @TT "Q_i"@ is @TT "0"@ and @TT "Ass(M/Q_i) = {p_i}"@ for some associated prime @TT "p_i"@ of @TT "M"@.

      Here minimality means that the associated primes of the submodules are pairwise distinct,
      and that the decomposition is irredundant, i.e. no submodule contains the intersection of the others.
      The {\tt i}-th element of this output is primary to the {\tt i}-th element of @TT "associatedPrimes M"@.
      The algorithm used is inspired by the Eisenbud-Huneke-Vasconcelos algorithm, modified to work for modules.
    Example
      R = QQ[x_0..x_3]
      (I1,I2,I3) = ({1,2,3},{2,3},{4,5}) / monomialCurveIdeal_R
      M = comodule I1 ++ comodule I2 ++ comodule I3
      associatedPrimes M
      C = primaryDecomposition M;
      netList C
      intersect C == 0 and all(C, isPrimary_M)
      C / degree
    Text
      Recall that in Macaulay2, a module is commonly represented as a @TO2 {"subquotient", "subquotient"}@, which is
      an ordered pair consisting of @TO generators@ and @TO relations@ represented as column matrices.
      As submodules of @TT "M"@, each module in the output list has the same relations as @TT "M"@,
      and has generators which are @TT "R"@-linear combinations of generators of @TT "M"@,
      where @TT "R = ring M"@.

      To obtain a primary decomposition of a submodule @TT "N"@, run this function on the quotient @TT "M/N"@.
      Note that the @TT "/"@ command does not check whether @TT "N"@ is actually a submodule of @TT "M"@, and
      a non-sensible result may be returned if this is not the case.
    -- Example
    --   N = coker map(M, R^1, transpose matrix{{1_R,1,1}}) -- coker of diagonal map
    --   primaryDecomposition N
    --   netList(oo/gens)
    Text
      This function generalizes primary decomposition of ideals (more precisely, cyclic modules),
      as can be seen by calling @TT "primaryDecomposition comodule I"@ for an ideal @TT "I"@.
      For convenience, one can also call @TT "primaryDecomposition R"@ for a ring @TT "R"@
      (which is most useful when @TT "R"@ is a @TO "QuotientRing"@).
      When computing primary decompositions of ideals with this function, remember to add back
      the original ideal to obtain the desired primary ideals, as in the following example.
    Example
      I = intersect((ideal(x_0..x_3))^5, (ideal(x_0..x_2))^4, (ideal(x_0..x_1))^3)
      S = R/I
      associatedPrimes S
      comps = primaryDecomposition S
      apply(comps, Q -> ideal mingens(I + ideal gens Q))
      I == intersect oo
    Text
      The results of the computation are stored in @TT "M.cache#\"primaryComponents\""@,
      which is a @TO "HashTable"@ whose keys are associated primes and values are the
      corresponding primary components.
      The list of all associated prime ideals is also cached can be obtained with @TT "associatedPrimes M"@.
      The computation may be interrupted at any point, and can be resumed later without recomputing already
      known primary components. To display detailed information throughout the computation, set the global variable
      @TO "debugLevel"@ to a value greater than 0, e.g. @TT "debugLevel=1"@ (or @TT "debugLevel=2"@ for even more detail).

      This function has one optional input @TT "Strategy"@, which accepts 3
      values that determine the algorithm for finding embedded components.

-- FIXME
      @UL {
	  {TT "Res", PARA {"This strategy is closest to the original Eisenbud-Huneke-Vasconcelos method."}},
	  {TT "Hom"},
	  {TT "Sat"},
	  }@

      While the default (and typically fastest) strategy is @TT "Sat"@, it is recommended to try different
      @TT "Strategy"@ values if the computation of a particular embedded component is taking too long.
      One can start the computation with one strategy, and interrupt and resume with a different strategy
      (even multiple times) if desired.
  Caveat
    Note that although isolated components (i.e. those corresponding to minimal primes) are unique,
    embedded components are never unique, and thus specifying generators of an embedded component requires
    non-canonical choices. For speed purposes, this algorithm searches for embedded components obtained by adding a
    bracket power of the embedded prime, with exponent determined by the degrees of generators of the embedded
    prime and @TT "ann M"@. In particular, the generators of an embedded component may not be of minimal possible degree.

  Description
    Text
      {\tt ass} is an abbreviation for @TT "associatedPrimes"@.

      This function computes the list of associated primes for a module @TT "M"@ using Ext modules:
      the codimension {\tt i} associated primes of @TT "M"@ and $\mathrm{Ext}^i(M,R)$ are identical,
      as shown in Eisenbud-Huneke-Vasconcelos, Invent. Math. 110 (1992) 207-235.

      In some cases, @TO primaryDecomposition@ also computes the associated primes, in which case
      calling @TO associatedPrimes@ requires no new computation and the list of associated primes
      is in the same order as the list of primary components returned by @TO primaryDecomposition@.
      Conversely, calling @TO associatedPrimes@ beforehand will speed up the process of @TO (primaryDecomposition, Module)@.
    Example
      R = QQ[a..d]
      M = coker(transpose matrix{{1_R,1,1,1}} | diagonalMatrix vars R)
      associatedPrimes M
    Text
      For an ideal @TT "I"@, @TT "associatedPrimes I"@ is mathematically equivalent to @TT "associatedPrimes comodule I"@.
    Example
      I = intersect(ideal(a^2,b), ideal(a,b,c^5), ideal(b^4,c^4))
      associatedPrimes I
      associatedPrimes comodule I
    Text
      For a quotient ring @TT "R"@, @TT "associatedPrimes R"@ is equivalent to @TT "associatedPrimes ideal R"@,
      the associated primes of the defining ideal of @TT "R"@.
    Example
      R = QQ[x,y,z]/(x^2,x*y)
      associatedPrimes R
    Text
      If the ideal is @ofClass MonomialIdeal@, then a more efficient strategy written by Greg Smith
      and Serkan Hosten is used. The above comments about primary decomposition hold in this case too.
    Example
      R = QQ[a..f];
      I = monomialIdeal ideal"abc,bcd,af3,a2cd,bd3d,adf,f5"
      ass I
      primaryDecomposition I
    Text
      The list of associated primes corresponds to the list of primary components of @TT "I"@:
      the {\tt i}-th associated prime is the radical of the {\tt i}-th primary component.

      If a value to the option @TT "CodimensionLimit"@ is provided, then only associated primes
      of codimension at most this value are returned. This can save time if the big height
      (that is, the maximal codimension of an associated prime) is less than the projective dimension.
      This method stores the primes already found in a cache, and calling it with a different value
      of @TT "CodimensionLimit"@ will only perform further computation if it is necessary.

      There are three methods for computing associated primes in Macaulay2: If the ideal is a monomial
      ideal, use code that Greg Smith and Serkan Hosten wrote. If a primary decomposition has already
      been found, use the stashed associated primes found. If neither of these is the case, then use Ext
      modules to find the associated primes (this is @TT "Strategy => 1"@).
    Example
      S = QQ[a,b,c,d,e];
      I1 = ideal(a,b,c);
      I2 = ideal(a,b,d);
      I3 = ideal(a,e);
      P = I1*I2*I3
      L1 = associatedPrimes P
      L2 = apply(associatedPrimes monomialIdeal P, J -> ideal J)
      M1 = set apply(L1, I -> sort flatten entries gens I)
      M2 = set apply(L2, I -> sort flatten entries gens I)
      assert(M1 === M2)
    Text
      The method using Ext modules comes from Eisenbud-Huneke-Vasconcelos, Invent. Math 110 (1992) 207-235.

      See {\it Localization and Primary Decomposition of Polynomial ideals} by Shimoyama and Yokoyama, J. Symb. Comp. 22, 247-277 (1996).
    Example
      primaryDecomposition(I, Strategy => ShimoyamaYokoyama)
    Text
      @SUBSECTION "Strategy => Hybrid{associated primes strategy, localize strategy}"@

      Uses a hybrid of the Eisenbud-Huneke-Vasconcelos and Shimoyama-Yokoyama strategies.
      To use this strategy, the field @TT "Strategy"@ should be a list of two integers, indicating the
      strategy to use for finding associated primes and localizing, respectively.

      {\bf Warning:} Setting the second paramter to 1 works only if the ideal is homogeneous and equidimensional.
    Example
      Q = QQ[x,y];
      I = intersect(ideal(x^2), ideal(y^2))
      primaryDecomposition(I, Strategy => Hybrid{1,1})
      primaryDecomposition(I, Strategy => Hybrid{1,2})
      primaryDecomposition(I, Strategy => Hybrid{2,1})
      primaryDecomposition(I, Strategy => Hybrid{2,2})

  Description
    Text
      This method computes the kernel of the natural map from a module to its localization at a given prime ideal.
      The efficiency of this method is intimately tied to the efficiency of computation of associated primes for
      the module - if the associated primes of @TT "M"@ have previously been computed, then this method should
      finish quickly.
    Example
      R = QQ[x_0..x_3]
      (I1,I2,I3) = monomialCurveIdeal_R \ ({1,2,3},{2,3},{4,5})
      M = comodule I1 ++ comodule I2 ++ comodule I3

  Inputs

      the codimension of @TT "I"@ if known
    t:ZZ

  Outputs
    :Ideal
      generated by a regular sequence of length @TT "n"@ contained in @TT "I"@
  Description
    Text
      This method computes a regular sequence of length @TT "n"@ contained in a given ideal @TT "I"@.
      It attempts to do so by first trying "sparse" combinations of the generators, i.e. elements which
      are either generators or sums of two generators. If a sparse regular sequence is not found, then
      dense combinations of generators will be tried.

      If the length @TT "n"@ is either unspecified or greater than the codimension of @TT "I"@ then it
      is silently replaced with the codimension of @TT "I"@. The ideal @TT "I"@ should be in a polynomial
      (or at least Cohen-Macaulay) ring, so that @TT "codim I = grade I"@.
    Example
      R = QQ[x_0..x_7]
      I = intersect(ideal(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3), ideal(x_4,x_5,x_6,x_7), ideal(x_0,x_2,x_4,x_6), ideal(x_1,x_3,x_5,7))
      elapsedTime regSeqInIdeal I
    Text
      If @TT "I"@ is the unit ideal, then an ideal of variables of the ring is returned.

      If the codimension of @TT "I"@ is already known, then one can specify this, along with a time limit
      for each trial (normally this is taken from the length of time for computing codim I).
      This can result in a significant speedup:
      in the following example, @TT "codim I"@ takes more than a minute to complete.
    Example
      R = QQ[h,l,s,x,y,z]
      I = ideal(h*l-l^2-4*l*s+h*y,h^2*s-6*l*s^3+h^2*z,x*h^2-l^2*s-h^3,h^8,l^8,s^8)
      isSubset(I, ideal(s,l,h)) -- implies codim I == 3

      If $M$ is a module in a polynomial ring $R$, then the implementations of @TT "topComponents"@ and

	  TEX "If $codim Ext^d(M,R) = d$, then there really is an associated prime of codimension $d$.",

    remove components of lowest dimension
  Usage

    M:{Ideal,Module}
  Outputs
    :{Ideal,Module}
  Description
    Text
      This function yields the intersection of the primary components of @TT "M"@ except those of
      lowest dimension, and thus returns the ambient free module of @TT "M"@ (or unit ideal) if @TT "M"@
      is pure dimensional. For a very brief description of the method used, see @TO "topComponents"@.

      As an example we remove the lowest dimensional component of an ideal {\tt I}:
    Example
      R = ZZ/32003[a..d];
      I = intersect(ideal(a*b+a^2,b^2), ideal(a^2,b^2,c^2), ideal(b^3,c^3,d^3))
