    simpler documentation for functions and methods
  Description
    Text
      This package provides a simple, human-readable text format for documentation nodes
      as an alternative to the classic @TO "Macaulay2Doc :: hypertext list format"@
      accepted by the @TO "Macaulay2Doc :: document(List)"@ function.

      The new format is accepted by the @TO (doc, String)@ function for writing either a
      single or multiple documentation nodes from a string or file and adheres to the
      @wikipedia "off-side rule"@, i.e., using indentation to separate blocks.

    Documentation is created and stored so that after @TO installPackage@ is used,
    @TO help@ and @TO viewHelp@ can be used to access the corresponding documentation node(s)
  Description
   Text
    The string {\tt s} contains a series of sections describing the documentation to be
    produced. The first line of each section contains only a keyword that specifies the
    purpose of that section. The keywords must all be indented to the same level, and
    everything else must be further indented. Lines beginning with white space followed
    by two hyphens are ignored and can be used for commenting.

    @TO (document, String)@ is a synonym for @TO doc@.
    For backwards compatibility, the function @TT "multidoc"@ is also a synonym for @TO doc@.

   Text
    @HEADER2 "Template for documentation strings"@

    The variable {\tt docTemplate} is a @TO String@, which can be cut and pasted into a
    text file, to be used as a template for writing documentation for functions and other
    objects in a package.
   Code
    EXAMPLE { PRE docTemplate }

   Text
    @HEADER2 "Description of keywords allowed in documentation strings"@

    The only keyword which is always required is @TO Key@. Other valid keywords are:

   Text
    @HEADER2 "Markup keywords allowed in documentation strings"@

    The markup keywords allowed include many TeX commands, as allowed in @TO TEX@; for
    details and examples see @TO (html, TEX)@, allowing various mathematical expressions,
    such as $\PP^3$ or $x_i^{33} + 1/2$, to be displayed in the html form of the documentation.

    Also allowed is a pair of {\tt \@} characters, enclosing Macaulay2 code to be executed,
    yielding appropriate hypertext.  For example
   Pre
    The @TO Key@ section is required.
   Text
    will include a link to another node of the documentation. This package also provides a
    number of helper functions, such as the @TO arXiv@ function, which may be used to succinctly
    reference e-Prints. See @TO "Text"@ for other hypertext types.

    Note that any Macaulay2 code resulting in a @TO String@ or @TO Hypertext@ may be used inside
    {\tt \@...\@}, but for longer code it is easier to use the @TT "Code"@ keyword described above.

   Text
    @HEADER2 "Documenting multiple nodes at once"@

    If the least indented keyword in the documentation string {\tt s} is @TT "Node"@,
    possibly occurring multiple times, multiple documentation nodes will be prepared.

    @UL {{ TT "Node", PARA {"The text following each such keyword is handled just as by ",
                TO doc, " resulting in a separate documentation node."}}}@

    See @HREF {currentLayout#"packages" | "SimpleDoc/doc.txt", "SimpleDoc/doc.txt"}@
    for an example of how the @TT "Node"@ keyword is used in documenting this package.
