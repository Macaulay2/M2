     	  decompose free resolutions and graded modules with a semisimple Lie group action
     Description
     	  Text
     	       This package provides tools to study the representation
	       theoretic structure of equivariant free resolutions and graded 
	       modules with the action of a semisimple Lie group. The methods
	       of this package allow one to consider the free modules in an
	       equivariant resolution, or the graded components of a module,
	       as representations of a semisimple Lie group by means of their
	       weights and to obtain their decomposition into highest weight
	       representations.
	       
	       This package implements an algorithm introduced in 
	       @HREF("http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1900","Galetto - Propagating 
		weights of tori along free resolutions")@.
	       The methods of this package are meant to be used in 
	       characteristic zero.
	       
	       The following links contain some sample computations carried out
	       using this package. 
	       The first and second example are discussed in more detail, so we
	       recommend reading through them first.

     Description
     	  Text
	       Let $G$ be a semisimple Lie group of Dynkin type @TT "D"@ which 
	       acts on @TT "R"@ compatibly with the grading. Let $T\subset G$ 
	       be a maximal torus and assume the variables in @TT "R"@ are 
	       weight vectors for the action of $T$. This function is used to 
	       assign a weight to each  variable of @TT "R"@. Knowing these 
	       weights allows Macaulay2 to return the weight of monomials of 
	       @TT "R"@ upon request.
	       
	       For more information on inputting the Dynkin type of the group 
	       the user should consult the documentation of the 
	       @TT "WeylGroups"@ package.
	       
	       Weights are expressed with respect to the basis of 
	       fundamental weights in the weight lattice associated to the 
	       root system of the given type @TT "D"@. In this package, each 
	       weight $w$ is represented by a list of integers, namely the 
	       coefficients of $w$ in the basis of fundamental weights.
	       
	       In the following example, the polynomial ring @TT "R"@ is the
	       symmetric algebra over $V$, where $V=\mathbb{C}^4$ and is acted
	       upon by the group $SL_4 (\mathbb{C})$.

     	  Example
	       R=QQ[x_1..x_4]

	       If @TT "r"@ is a monomial, this will return the weight of

	       in the support of @TT "r"@ each counted with multiplicity 
	       equal to its exponent. If @TT "r"@ is a polynomial, then 
	       the weight of the leading monomial is returned (which may differ 
	       from the weights of the other monomials of @TT "r"@).

	       In the following example, the polynomial ring @TT "R"@ is the

	       Let $T$ be a torus which acts on a polynomial ring compatibly

	       weight vectors for the action of $T$.
	       
	       Use this method on a $T$-equivariant map of graded free modules,
	       to obtain the weights of the domain from the weights of the
	       codomain (or viceversa).

	       The weights of the variables in the ring must be set a priori,

	       This method is called by other methods in this package. The only
	       reason for using this method directly is that it returns a

     Description
     	  Text
	       Let $\phi:E\rightarrow F$ be a homogeneous map of graded free 
	       modules. Fix a homogeneous basis $\{e_i\}$ of $E$ and assume 
	       $\phi$ is minimal, in the sense that $\{\phi (e_i)\}$ is a 
	       minimal set of generators of the image of $\phi$.
	       Moreover, suppose $\phi$ is equivariant for the action 
	       of an algebraic torus and fix a homogeneous basis of weight
	       vectors $\{f_j\}$ of $F$.
	       Use this function to recover the weights of the domain $E$ 
	       from the weights of the codomain $F$ (or viceversa, setting the
	       optional input @TO "Forward"@ to @TT "true"@.).
	       
	       The input consists of @TT "M"@, the matrix of $\phi$ with 
	       respect to the bases $\{e_i\}$ and $\{f_j\}$, together with
	       @TT "W"@, a list of weights $\{w_j\}$ such that $w_j$ is the 
	       weight of $f_j$.
	       
	       If the optional argument @TO "LeadingTermTest"@ is @TT "true"@
	       (and it is by default),
	       a new homogeneous basis $\{e_i'\}$ for $E$ is computed.
	       The change of basis from $\{e_i\}$ to $\{e_i'\}$, given by the 
	       matrix @TT "C"@, is chosen so that the columns of the matrix 
	       @TT "M*inverse(C)"@ have all different leading terms.
	       This is a sufficient condition for the algorithm to work.
	       The matrix @TT "C"@ is part of the output.
	       The user can choose to avoid this change of basis by 
	       setting this optional argument to @TT "false"@;
	       then @TT "C"@ is taken to be the identity matrix.
	       
	       The output @TT "V"@ is a list of weights $\{v_i\}$ such that 
	       there is a basis of homogeneous weight vectors $\{e_i''\}$ 
	       of $E$, with $v_i$ the weight of $e_i''$.
	       Notice that the change of basis from $\{e_i\}$ to $\{e_i''\}$ is
	       not retuned.
	       
	       This method implements an algorithm introduced in 
	       Galetto - {\it Propagating weights of tori along free 
	       resolutions} (in preparation).
	       
	       In the following example, the polynomial ring @TT "R"@ is the
	       symmetric algebra over $\mathbb{C}^2 \otimes \mathbb{C}^4$, 
	       with the natural action of $SL_2 (\mathbb{C}) \times SL_4 
	       (\mathbb{C})$.
	       The map $\phi$ is the unique (up to scalars) equivariant map
	       $\mathbb{C}^4 \otimes R(-1) \rightarrow (\mathbb{C}^2)^* \otimes
	        R$.
	       If $\{f_1,f_2\}$ and $\{e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4\}$ are the coordinate
	       bases of $\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^4$ respectively, then
	       @TT "M"@ is the matrix of $\phi$ with respect to the bases 
	       $\{f_1^*,f_2^*\}$ and $\{e_1,e_1+e_2,e_3,e_4\}$.

     	  Example

	       V
	       C
	       M*inverse(C)

     	  Text
     	       While the first and second columns of @TT "M"@ have the same 
	       leading terms, all the columns of @TT "M*inverse(C)"@

	       The weights in @TT "V"@ are in order the weights of $e_4$, $e_3$,
	        $e_2$ and $e_1$.
	       
	       A list of weights obtained using this method can be decomposed

	       The decomposition of a representation is described by means of a

	       All weights are expressed with respect to the basis of

	       Finally the keys of the nested hash tables are tallies whose
	       keys are the highest weights of certain irreducible 
	       representations and 
	       those representations.
	       
	       In the following example, the polynomial ring @TT "R"@ is the
	       symmetric algebra over $\mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^4$, 
	       with the natural action of $G = SL_3 (\mathbb{C}) \times SL_4 
	       (\mathbb{C})$.
	       The complex is the minimal free resolution of the ideal of
	       $2\times 2$ minors of a generic $3\times 4$ matrix.
	       We choose to provide the weights for the module in homological
	       dimension zero, so we input 0 for the second argument.
	       The module in homological dimension zero has rank one and $G$ 
	       acts trivially on it hence it has only one weight, the zero
	       weight.

     	  Example
	       R=QQ[x_(1,1)..x_(3,4)];
	       G=genericMatrix(R,4,3)
	       I=minors(2,G);
	       resI=res I
	       betti resI
	       D=dynkinType{{"A",2},{"A",3}};
	       U={{1,0,1,0,0},{1,0,-1,1,0},{1,0,0,-1,1},{1,0,0,0,-1},{-1,1,1,0,0},{-1,1,-1,1,0},{-1,1,0,-1,1},{-1,1,0,0,-1},{0,-1,1,0,0},{0,-1,-1,1,0},{0,-1,0,-1,1},{0,-1,0,0,-1}};
	       setWeights(R,D,U)
	       highestWeightsDecomposition(resI,0,{{0,0,0,0,0}})
	  
	  Text
	       This shows, for example, that the third module in the complex
	       decomposes as $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes S_{2,1,1} \mathbb{C}^4 \oplus
	       S_{3,1}\mathbb{C}^3$ generated in degree 4. Similarly, the fourth
	       module decomposes as $S_2 \mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^4$ in
	       degree 5 and $S_{2,2,2} \mathbb{C}^4$ in degree 6.
	       Here $S_\lambda$ denotes the Schur functor corresponding to the
	       partition $\lambda$.
	       
	       To obtain only a partial decomposition, we may use the optional
	       argument @TO "Range"@.

     	  Example
	       highestWeightsDecomposition(resI,0,{{0,0,0,0,0}},Range=>{0,2})

	  Text
	       When the first free module in the complex has rank one,
	       as when resolving a quotient of @TT "R"@, 
	       then the group $G$ acts trivially on it.
	       Then we may use a simplified version of the command with 
	       the complex as the only argument.

	       This function takes in the Dynkin type of a root system
	       along with the complete list of weights of a representation
	       and returns the decomposition into highest weight 
	       representations. It implements a modified version of
	       Freudenthal's multiplicity formula based on the algorithm
	       discussed in chapter 8.9 of W. A. de Graaf, {\it Lie algebras: 
	       theory and algorithms}, North-Holland Publishing, and the
	       article @HREF("http://dx.doi.org/10.1090/S0273-0979-1982-15021-2",

	       weight multiplicities")@.
	       
	       The only application of this function is to decompose the
	       list of weights obtained with @TO "propagateWeights"@.

     	  Example

     Caveat
     	  To speed up the decomposition of the list of weights in the input,
	  this function discards all non
	  dominant weights, then decomposes the dominant character obtained
	  from the remaining dominant weights. If the dominant weights in 
	  the list do not form the dominant character of a representation
	  an error is returned. This is typically caused by assigning the 
	  wrong weights to the variables of the ring or to the presentation
	  of a module. However, if the non dominant weights in @TT "L"@ do
	  not belong to the character of a representation, this will go
	  undetected by this function.
