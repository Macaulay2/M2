  Headline
    a package for creating families of ideals with the same initial ideal
  Description
    Text
      The {\em GroebnerStrata} package is designed to compute, given a
      monomial ideal in a polynomial ring, (and a term order, coming
      from the polynomial ring), a family of homogeneous ideals all
      with the given monomial ideal as its lead term (initial) ideal.

      The {\em GroebnerStrata} package is designed for computing homogeneous
      strata and parameter families for monomial ideals in polynomial rings.
      In certain instances homogeneous strata can be used to compute local
      coordinates on Hilbert Schemes.
    Text
      Here is an example of the basic use of the package.  We compute the Groebner family
      of the ideal $(a^2, ab, b^2, ac)$.  This is an ideal in a polynomial ring with variables the
      same as $S$, and whose coefficient ring is a polynomial ring containing all of the
      parameters.  The @TO (groebnerStratum, Ideal)@ function returns the ideal in the parameters
      of the locus of parameters, for which the given family is a Groebner basis.
    Example
      kk = ZZ/101;
      S = kk[a..d];
      M = ideal"a2,ab,b2,ac";
      F = groebnerFamily M;
      netList F_*
      J = trim groebnerStratum F
    Text
      The ideal of the parameter space of all homogeneous ideals with this lead term ideal
      is an ideal in 24 variables.  Often, these parameter ideals are in too many variables
      to easily analyze them.  But in this case we can determine the irreducible components
      of the ideal $J$.  There are two components, of dimensions 8 and 11.  Note that they
      are both rational varieties.
    Example
      compsJ = decompose J;
      compsJ = compsJ/trim;
      compsJ/dim
      netList compsJ_0_*
      netList compsJ_1_*
    Text
      This tells us that there are 2 components (at least over the given field).
      Their dimensions are 11, 8.
    Text
      We can find random points on each component, since these components are rational.
    Example
      pt1 = randomPointOnRationalVariety compsJ_0
      pt2 = randomPointOnRationalVariety compsJ_1
      F1 = sub(F, (vars S)|pt1)
      F2 = sub(F, (vars S)|pt2)
      decompose F1
      decompose F2
    Text
      Note, the general element of one component is a plane conic union a point.
      (The dimension of the locus of all such is: (choice of plane) + (choice of degree 2 in plane) + choice of point.
      This is 3 + 5 + 3 = 11.
      
      The other component consists of two skew lines.  This has dimension (choice of line) + (choice of line).
      This is 4 + 4 = 8.  Also notice that the 2 skew lines do not have to be defined over the 
      base field, as in this case.

      h is a list of values for w dotted with the difference of the exponent of

  Description
    Text
      In the first entry, this command returns a weight vector associated to a
      monomial order that places the generators of a monomial ideal $M$ ahead
      of standard monomials of the same degree.  The second entry is a list of
      values for the weight vector dotted with the difference of the exponent
      of each standard monomial for each generator and the corresponding
      generator.
    Example
      R = ZZ/32003[a,b,c, d];
      M = ideal (a^2, a*b, b^2);
      L = smallerMonomials M;
      findWeightVector(M,L)
    Text
      Note that the first generator listed for $M$ is $a^2$, and the first
      corresponding standard monomial is $a*c$.  The difference of these two
      monomials exponent vectors is $(1,0,-1,0)$.  This vector dotted with the
      weight vector $(2,2,1,1)$ gives the value $1$, which is the first value
      in the second list.

      Note that the desired term ordering, and hence weight vector, may not exist.
      In this case, null is returned.
    Example
      M = ideal"ab"
      L1 = standardMonomials M

  Description
    Text
      Given a monomial ideal $M$ in a polynomial ring $R$, this computes the
      parameter families of homogeneous ideals where $M$ could be their initial
      ideal.  These families are obtained from either the standard monomials to
      the generators of $M$, or the standard monomials smaller than the
      generators of $M$ but of the same degree as these generators.  In the
      former case we obtain a family of all ideals where $M$ could be their
      initial ideal.  In the latter case, we obtain such a family with respect
      to a given term order.
    Example
      R = ZZ/32003[a,b,c,d];
      M = ideal (a^2, a*b, b^2)
      F = groebnerFamily M
      netList F_*
      U = ring F
      T = coefficientRing U
      gens T
      gens U
    Text
      Here, $F$ is the family of homogeneous ideals having $M$ as their initial
      ideal, under the term order of the ring of $M$.
      
      The optional argument @TO AllStandard@ is boolean, taking the value
      $true$ to compute the family of all homogeneous ideals with a given
      initial ideal and the value $false$ to compute the family with respect to
      a given order.  The default value for this argument is false.
      
      If $L$ is not given, then it is computed using @TO standardMonomials@ (if 
      AllStandard is true), or @TO smallerMonomials@ (if AllStandard is false).
    Example
      L = standardMonomials M
      F2 = groebnerFamily (M, L)
    Text  
      Note that $F$ and $F_2$ are the same family, in this case.

  Outputs

  Description
    Text
      Given a monomial ideal $M$, this command returns a family of ideals
      having $M$ as an initial ideal, and conditions on the parameters so that
      the family is flat.  If the optional input @TO AllStandard@ is specified
      as $true$, the family of all homogeneous ideals having $M$ as an initial
      ideal is computed, and if it is specified as $false$ the family of all
      homogeneous ideals having $M$ as an initial ideal with respect to the
      given term order is computed.  
    Example
      R = ZZ/32003[a,b,c]
      M = ideal (a^2, a*b, b^2)
      F = groebnerFamily M
      J = trim groebnerStratum F
    Text
      In this example, F is the universal family, and L is the ideal giving the
      conditions on the parameters.  In general, several of the parameters are
      unnecessary. Note that H is an ideal in a ring with far fewer parameters.
      This is because a maximal set of eliminable parameters from the original
      ideal of conditions on parameters have been eliminated.  If the full
      ideal in the polynomial ring over all the parameters is desired, set the
      optional argument $Minimalize$ to false.
    Example
      J2 = trim groebnerStratum(F, Minimalize => false)

    I:Ideal
      in a polynomial ring $S$ over a base field or coefficient ring

    H:HashTable
      Whose keys describe which submatrix in the resolution this is, and whose values are those
      submatrices (placed into the original coefficient ring $A$)
  Description
    Text
      The Schreyer resolution of $I$ (which is generally non-minimal) is computed.
      The nonminimal parts are the submatrices in this resolution which do not involve
      the variables in $S$.  They are elements in the base ring $A$.  For instance,
      {\tt H#(\ell, d)} is the submatrix of the matrix from $C_{\ell+1} \to C_{\ell}$
      sending degree $d$ to degree $d$.
    Text
      The ranks of these matrices for a specific parameter value determine exactly the 
      minimal Betti table for the ideal $I$, evaluated at that parameter point.
    Text
      Now for our example.
    Example
      kk = ZZ/101;
      S = kk[a..d];
      F = groebnerFamily ideal"a2,ab,ac,b2,bc2,c3"
      (C, H) = nonminimalMaps F;
      betti(C, Weights => {1,1,1,1})
    Text
      We see that there are 4 maps that are nonminimal (of sizes $2
      \times 4$, $5 \times 2$, $1 \times 3$, and $1 \times 1$).
    Example
      keys H
      H#(2,3)
      H#(3,4)
      H#(3,5)
      H#(4,6)
    Text
      Let's impose the condition that the map {\tt H#(2,3)} vanishes (so has rank 0).
      The Betti diagram of such ideals is not the one for a set of 6 generic points in $\PP^3$.
    Example
      J = trim(minors(1, H#(2,3)) + groebnerStratum F);
      compsJ = decompose J;
      #compsJ
      pt1 = randomPointOnRationalVariety compsJ_0
      pt2 = randomPointOnRationalVariety compsJ_1
      F1 = sub(F, (vars S)|pt1)
      betti res F1
      F2 = sub(F, (vars S)|pt2)
      betti res F2
    Text
      What are the ideals F1 and F2?
    Example
      netList decompose F1
      netList decompose F2
    Text
      We can determine what these represent.  One should be a set of 6 points, where 5 lie
      on a plane.  The other should be 6 points with 3 points on one line, and the other 3 points
      on a skew line.
