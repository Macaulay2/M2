    	compute jets of various algebraic, geometric and combinatorial objects
    Description
    	Text
	    This package enables computations with jet functors.
	    It introduces the @TO jets@ method to compute jets of
	    polynomial rings, ideals, quotients, ring homomorphisms,
	    and varieties.
	    The construction of jets follows an algebraic procedure
	    discussed in several sources, including the first three
	    references below.
	    
	    Additional features include an alternative algorithm to compute
	    the radical of jets of monomial ideals, a function
	    to construct jets of graphs, a method for principal components of jets,
	    and an option for jets with "projective" gradings.

    	caching scheme for jets computations
    Description
    	Text
	    In many cases, the @TO jets@ method will store its results inside
	    a @TO CacheTable@ in the base object. When the method is called
	    again with the same or a lower jets order, the result is pulled
	    from the cache.
	    
	    For polynomial rings, data is stored under @TT "*.jet"@.
    	Example
	    R = QQ[x,y]
	    R.?jet
	    jets(3,R)
	    R.?jet
	    peek R.jet
    	Text
	    Note also that rings of jets are built as towers from lower to
	    higher jets orders. Therefore it is possible to store a single
	    ring of the highest order computed thus far.
	    
	    For ideals, data is stored under @TT "*.cache.jet"@.
	    A single matrix is stored containing generators for the
	    highest order of jets computed thus far.
	    Generators for lower orders are recovered from this matrix
	    without additional computations.
    	Example
	    I = ideal (x^2 - y)
	    I.cache.?jet
	    elapsedTime jets(3,I)
	    I.cache.?jet
	    peek I.cache.jet
	    elapsedTime jets(3,I)
	    elapsedTime jets(2,I)
    	Text
	    For quotient rings, data is stored under @TT "*.jet"@.
	    Each jets order gives rise to a different quotient
	    that is stored separately under @TT "*.jet.jetsRing"@
	    (order zero jets are always included by default).
    	Example
	    Q = R/I
	    Q.?jet
	    jets(3,Q)
	    Q.?jet
	    peek Q.jet.jetsRing
	    jets(2,Q)
	    peek Q.jet.jetsRing
    	Text
	    For ring homomorphisms, data is stored under @TT "*.cache.jet"@.
	    A single matrix is stored describing the map for the
	    highest order of jets computed thus far.
	    Lower orders map are recovered from this matrix
	    without additional computations.
    	Example
	    S = QQ[t]
	    f = map(S,Q,{t,t^2})
	    isWellDefined f
	    f.cache.?jet
	    elapsedTime jets(3,f)
	    f.cache.?jet
	    peek f.cache.jet
	    elapsedTime jets(2,f)
    	Text
	    Projective jets data is stored separately under @TT "*.projet"@
	    or @TT "*.cache.projet"@ to accommodate for the different grading.
    	Example
	    jets(2,I,Projective=>true)
	    peek I.cache.projet
	    peek R.projet
    Caveat
    	No data is cached when computing jets of affine varieties and (hyper)graphs,
	radicals, or principal components.

    Description
    	Text
	    This function is provided by the package @TO Jets@.  Rings are 
	    constructed incrementally as towers.  The function returns the 
	    ring with variables in the jets order requested, and coefficients 
	    in all lower orders.  The grading or multigrading of the jets ring 
	    follows from that of the base ring.

    	Text
	    The convention for labeling variables in the jets of polynomial ring
	    is to append the order of the jets to name of the variables in the
	    base ring. Existing subscripts are preserved.
    	Example
	    A = QQ[a_1..a_3]
	    JA = jets(1,A)
	    describe JA
    	Text
	    Note that the coefficient ring of the polynomial ring does not need
	    to be a field. The jets of the input polynomial ring will be a
	    polynomial ring with the same coefficient ring as the input.
    	Example
	    Zi = ZZ[i]/ideal(i^2+1)
	    B = Zi[b_1..b_3]
	    JB = jets(1,B)
	    describe JB
    Caveat
    	With @TT "Projective=>true"@ the jet variables of order zero have degree 0,
	therefore no heft vector exist for the ambient ring of the jets.
	As a result, certain computations will not be supported, and others may run more slowly.

        Rings of jets are usually constructed as towers of rings with

	    \mathcal{J}_s (\mathbb{A}^n_\Bbbk) \cong \mathbb{A}^{n(s+1)}_\Bbbk.$$
	    Let $I$ denote the ideal of $X_\mathrm{sing}$ in this embedding,
	    and let $J$ denote the ideal of $\mathcal{J}_s (X)$; both ideals
	    live in the polynomial ring $\Bbbk [\mathbb{A}^{n(s+1)}_\Bbbk]$.
	    We have an equality of sets $$\mathcal{J}_s (X_\mathrm{reg}) =
	    \mathcal{J}_s (X) \setminus X_\mathrm{sing} = \mathbf{V} (J)
	    \setminus \mathbf{V} (I).$$ By Theorem 10 in Chapter 4, §4 of
	    @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3",
		"D.A. Cox, J. Little, D. O'Shea - Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms")@,
	    if $\Bbbk$ is algebraically closed, then there is an equality
	    $$\mathbf{V} (J\colon I^\infty) = \overline{\mathbf{V} (J)
	    \setminus \mathbf{V} (I)} = \overline{\mathcal{J}_s (X_\mathrm{reg})}.$$
	    This function returns the ideal $J\colon I^\infty$.
	    
	    If $J$ is known to be a radical ideal, then
	    $\mathbf{V} (J\colon I) = \overline{\mathbf{V} (J)
	    \setminus \mathbf{V} (I)}$ by Corollary 11 in Chapter 4, §4 of
	    @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3",
		"D.A. Cox, J. Little, D. O'Shea - Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms")@.
	    In this case, the user may pass the option @TT "Saturate=>false"@
	    to return the ideal $J\colon I$, which can speed up computations.
	    
	    As an example, consider the union of three non parallel lines
	    in the affine plane. We compute the principal component of the
	    jets of order two.
    	Example
	    R = QQ[x,y]
	    I = ideal(x*y*(x+y-1))
	    PC = principalComponent(2,I)
    	Text
	    Despite the name, the principal component need not be a component
	    of the jet scheme (i.e., it need not be irreducible). In this example,
	    the principal component has degree 3 and is the union of three components
	    of degree 1.
    	Example
	    P = primaryDecomposition jets(2,I)
	    any(P,c -> c == PC)
	    PC == intersect(select(P,c -> degree c == 1))
	Text
	    If $I$ is a monomial ideal, this method uses a different characterization
	    of the principal component (see Theorem 6.7 in
		@arXiv("2407.01836","F. Galetto, N. Iammarino, and T. Yu,
	    Jets and principal components of monomial ideals, and very well-covered graphs")@).
    Caveat
    	This function requires computation of a singular locus,
	a saturation (or quotient), and jets, with each step being
	potentially quite time consuming.

    	jets of monomial ideals
    Description
    	Text
	    As observed in @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1080/00927870500454927",
	    "R.A. Goward and K.E. Smith, The jet scheme of a monomial scheme")@ [GS06],
	    the ideal of jets of a monomial ideal is typically not a monomial ideal.
	Example
	    R = QQ[x,y,z]
	    I = ideal(x*y*z)
	    J2I = jets(2,I)
	Text
	    However, by [GS06, Theorem 3.1], the radical is always a (squarefree) monomial ideal. In
	    fact, the proof of [GS06, Theorem 3.2] shows that the radical is generated by the individual
	    terms in the generators of the ideal of jets. This observation provides an alternative
	    algorithm for computing radicals of jets of monomial ideals, which can be faster than the
	    default radical computation in Macaulay2.
    	Example
	    elapsedTime jetsRadical(2,I)
	    elapsedTime radical J2I
	Text
	    For a monomial hypersurface, [GS06, Theorem 3.2] describes the minimal primes of the
	    ideal of jets. Moreover, the main theorem in @arXiv("math/0607638",
	    "C. Yuen, Multiplicity of jet schemes of monomial schemes")@ counts the multiplicity of the jet scheme
	    of a monomial hypersurface along its minimal primes (see also @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1080/00927870701512168",
	    "C. Yuen, The multiplicity of jet schemes of a simple normal crossing divisor")@). We compute the
	    minimal primes, then use the @TO "LocalRings::LocalRings"@ package to compute their multiplicities in
	    the second jet scheme of the example above. Note that we need to flatten the polynomial ring
	    of jets because the @TT "LocalRings"@ package does not allow towers of rings.
	Example
	    P = minimalPrimes J2I
	    (A,f) = flattenRing ring J2I

    	jets of graphs
    Description
    	Text
	    Jets of graphs were introduced in @arXiv("2104.08933","F. Galetto, E. Helmick, and M. Walsh,
    		Jet graphs")@ [GHW21]. Starting with a
	    finite, simple graph $G$, one may construct a quadratic squarefree
	    monomial ideal $I(G)$ (known as the \emph{edge ideal} of the graph) by
	    converting edges to monomials.
	    One may then consider the radical of the ideal of $s$-jets of $I(G)$,
	    which is again a quadratic squarefree monomial ideal. The graph
	    corresponding to this ideal is the graph of $s$-jets of $G$, denoted
	    $\mathcal{J}_s (G)$.
	    
	    Jets of graphs and hypergraphs can be obtained by applying the
	    @TO jets@ method to objects of type @TO "EdgeIdeals::Graph"@ and
	    @TO "EdgeIdeals::HyperGraph"@ from the Macaulay2 @TO "EdgeIdeals::EdgeIdeals"@ package
	    (which is automatically loaded by the @TO Jets@ package).
	    Consider, for example, the graph in the figure below.
    	Code
      	    IMG ("src" => replace("PKG", "Jets", currentLayout#"package") | "graph.png",
		"alt" => "a graph on 5 vertices", "height" => "300")

	    R = QQ[a..e]
	    G = graph({{a,c},{a,d},{a,e},{b,c},{b,d},{b,e},{c,e}})
	Text
	    We compute the first and second order jets, and list their edges.
    	Example
	    J1G = jets(1,G); netList pack(7,edges J1G)
	    J2G = jets(2,G); netList pack(7,edges J2G)
	Text
	    As predicted in [GHW21, Theorem 3.1], all jets have the same
	    chromatic number.
	Example
	    apply({G,J1G,J2G},chromaticNumber)
    	Text
	    By contrast, jets may not preserve the property of being co-chordal.
    	Example
	    apply({G,J1G,J2G},x -> isChordal complementGraph x)	    
    	Text
	    Using Fröberg's Theorem (cf. R. Fröberg, On Stanley-Reisner rings),
	    we deduce that although
	    the edge ideal of a graph may have a linear free resolution, the edge
	    ideals of its jets may not have linear resolutions.
        	
	    Finally, we compare minimal vertex covers of the graph and of its
	    second order jets.
    	Example
    	    vertexCovers G
	    netList pack(2,vertexCovers J2G)

	    Consider the determinantal varieties $X_r$ of

	    vanishing of minors of size $r+1$.  We illustrate computationally some
	    of the known results about jets.
	Example
	    R = QQ[x_(1,1)..x_(3,3)]
	    G = genericMatrix(R,3,3)
	Text
	    Since $X_0$ is a single point, its first jet scheme consists of a

	    JI1 = jets(1,I1)
	    dim JI1, isPrime JI1

	    The jets of $X_2$ (the determinantal hypersurface) are known to be
	    irreducible (see Theorem 3.1 in @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpaa.2004.06.001",

	    Since $X_2$ is a complete intersection and has rational singularities
	    (see Corollary 6.1.5(b) in @HREF("https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511546556",

	    this also follows from a more general result of M. Mustaţă

	    and Corollary 4.13 in [Doc13] all count the number of components;

	    the components further. As expected, the first jet scheme of $X_1$ has
	    two components, one of them an affine space.

	    The other component is the so-called principal component of the jet
	    scheme, i.e., the Zariski closure of the first jets of the smooth
	    locus of $X_1$. To check this, we first establish that the first jet
	    scheme is reduced (i.e. its ideal is radical), then use the
