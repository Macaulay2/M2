        the role of the coefficient field
    Description
      Text
        The SumsOfSquares package works with two coefficient rings: the rational numbers $\QQ$ and the real numbers $\RR$.
        Almost all operations in this package rely on a numerical semidefinite programming @TO Solver@.  
        When calling such a solver, even if the input was a polynomial with rational coefficients, the result is numerical.  
        The package makes some effort to round and return a rational result, but this can fail, independent of whether a rational sum-of-squares decomposition exists or not.
        In case of failure, a real result is returned.
        The following example of Scheiderer is a sum of squares, but does not admit any rational decomposition.  Consequently the package must return a real solution.
      Example
        f = library("Scheiderer", QQ[x,y,z])
        sol = solveSOS (f);
        sosPoly sol
      Text
        Given a sum-of-squares decomposition with real coefficients, it is often useful to ignore the squares with very small coefficients.
        The function @TO (clean,RR,SOSPoly)@ removes the squares whose coefficients are smaller than a given tolerance.
      Example
        clean (0.001, sosPoly sol)

        A type to store sums-of-squares polynomials
    Description
      Text
        A polynomial $f\in K[x]$ is a sum of squares (SOS) if it can be written as
        $$f = \sum_i d_i g_i^2,$$
        where the $g_i$ are polynomials in $K[x]$ and the $d_i$ are positive weights in $K$.
        This data type stores polynomials as sums of squares.
        The type is a hash table consisting of the polynomials to be
        squared and summed (the 'generators'), corresponding coefficients,
        and the base ring.  
        We can construct an object of type SOSPoly from the result of sum-of-squares problem.
        See @TO SDPResult@ for more on this.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = 2*x^4+5*y^4-2*x^2*y^2+2*x^3*y;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        sosPoly sol
      Text
        One can also construct an object of type SOSPolys by specifying all their ingredients.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        s = sosPoly(R, {x+1,y}, {2,3} )
        peek s
      Text
        The ingredients of a sum of squares can be recovered using the expected commands.
      Example
        gens s
        ring s
        coefficients s
      Text
        The length of a sum-of-squares polynomial is the number of squares.
      Example
        length s
      Text
        Sums of squares support many common operations with polynomials.
      Example
        2 * s
        s + s
        s * s
        s == s
      Text
        The actual polynomial can be recovered using @TO(value,SOSPoly)@.
      Example
        value s
      Text
        We can also produce a formal @TO Expression@.
      Example
        expression s
      Text
        Objects of type @TO SOSPoly@ support the @TO substitute@ command.  
        This cannot be used to change the coefficient field, though.  
        See @TO "coefficient field"@ for some of the limitations.
      Example
        S = QQ[x,y,z];
        sub (s, S)

        If the Gram matrix is different from null, then the sum-of-squares polynomial can be recovered with @TO sosPoly@.

        This method solves sums-of-squares problems.
        Given a rational (or real) polynomial $f(x)$, it attempts to find a rational (or real) 
        positive semidefinite matrix $Q$ and a vector of monomials $mon$ such that
        $$f(x) = mon' Q mon.$$
        The algorithm first computes a floating point solution,
        and then tries to obtain an exact solution by rounding the numerical result. 
        If the rounding fails, the numerical solution is returned.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = 2*x^4+5*y^4-2*x^2*y^2+2*x^3*y;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        Q = sol#GramMatrix
        mon = sol#Monomials
        transpose(mon)*Q*mon - f
      Text
        {\bf SOS with parameters:}
        If the coefficients of the polynomial are linearly parametrized, we can search for parameters which render a polynomial to be a sum of squares.
        In the following example, the variable $t$ will be treated as a free parameter.
      Example
        R = QQ[x][t];
        f = (t-1)*x^4+1/2*t*x+1;
        sol = solveSOS f;
        sosPoly sol
        sol#Parameters
      Text
        It is possible to solve sums-of-squares problems with several parameters.
        In the following example we increase two of the coefficients of the Robinson polynomial until it becomes a sum of squares.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y,z][s,t]
        g = library("Robinson", {x,y,z}) + s*x^6 + t*y^6
        sol = solveSOS g;
        sol#Parameters
      Text
        {\bf SOS with parameter optimization:}
        The method also allows to optimize a linear function of the parameters.
        More precisely, given a polynomial $f(x;p)$ that depends affinely on some parameters $p$, we can solve the problem

        $$min_{p} \, objFun(p) \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, f(x; p) \, is SOS $$

        In the following example we minimize $-t$ in order to find a lower bound for the polynomial $x^2-3x$:
      Example
        R = QQ[x][t];
        f = x^2 - 3*x - t;
        sol = solveSOS (f, -t, RoundTol=>12);
        sol#Parameters
      Text
        By default the method tries to obtain rational values of the parameters.
        Since there is a trade-off between rounding and optimality, we specify the @TO2 {RoundTol,"rounding precision"}@ as an optional input argument.

        The first invocation is to give a one row matrix with polynomial entries and a degree bound.
        The method then tries to find a sum of squares in the generated ideal.
        More precisely, given equations $h_1(x),...,h_m(x)$, the method looks for polynomial multipliers $h_i(x)$ such that $\sum_i l_i(x) h_i(x)$ is a sum of squares.
     Example
        R = QQ[x,y,z];
        h = matrix {{x^2-4*x+2*y^2, 2*z^2-y^2+2}};
        (sol,mult) = sosInIdeal (h, 2);
        sosPoly sol
        h * mult == sosPoly sol
     Text
        The second invocation is on a quotient ring, also with a degree bound.
        This tries to decompose the zero of the quotient ring as a sum of squares.
     Example
        S = R/ideal h;
        sol = sosInIdeal (S, 2);
        sosPoly sol
        sosPoly sol
    Caveat
        This implementation only works with the @TO2 {Solver,"solvers"}@ "CSDP" and "MOSEK".

    Description
      Text
        This method finds a lower bound for a polynomial or rational function $x\mapsto f(x)$.
        More precisely, this method solves the following relaxation

        $$max \, t \,\,\, s.t. \,\,\, f(x) - t \, is SOS $$

        In some cases the minimizer can be extracted with the method @TO recoverSolution@.
      Example
        R=QQ[x];
        f = (x-1)^2 + (x+3)^2;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound(f);
        (bound, recoverSolution sol)
        f - bound == sosPoly sol
      Text
        By default the method tries to obtain a rational lower bound.
        Since there is a trade-off between rounding and optimality, we specify the @TO2 {RoundTol,"rounding precision"}@ as an optional input argument.
      Text
        {\bf Quotient rings:}
        Given an ideal $I$, we can also find a lower bound for $f$ on the variety of $I$.
        This can be done by constructing the associated quotient ring.
        A degree bound must be provided.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y]/ideal(x^2 - x, y^2 - y);
        f = x - y;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound(f,2);
        bound
        f - bound == sosPoly sol
      Text
        {\bf Avoiding quotient rings:}
        Constructing the quotient ring is sometimes too expensive since it requires GrÃ¶bner bases.
        There is an alternative (though weaker) relaxation that avoids GrÃ¶bner bases computation.
        Given equations $h_1(x),...h_m(x)$, we can look for multipliers $l_i(x)$ such that $f(x) - t + \sum_i l_i(x) h_i(x)$ is a sum of squares.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,y];
        f = x - y;
        h = matrix{{x^2 - x, y^2 - y}};
        (bound,sol,mult) = lowerBound (f, h, 2);
        bound
        f - bound + h*mult == sosPoly sol
      Text
        {\bf Optimizing rational functions:}
        The following is an example of how to optimize a rational function.
      Example
        R = QQ[x];
        f = (x^2-x)/(x^2+1);
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound (f);

        tolerance for rational rounding
    Consequences
    Description
      Text
        The optional argument {\tt RoundTol} specifies the minimal rounding precision in $d$ binary digits.

        Sums-of-squares problems are solved numerically using a semidefinite programming solver, and afterwards the package attempts to round the floating point solution to rational numbers.
        The rounding strategy is guaranteed to work whenever the space of Gram matrices is full dimensional.
        For optimization problems the rounding may cause a loss in optimality.
        The argument {\tt RoundTol} allows to control the trade-off between optimality and simplicity.
        Higher values of {\tt RoundTol} lead to better solutions.
      Example
        R = QQ[x,z];
        f = x^4+x^2+z^6-3*x^2*z^2;
        (bound,sol) = lowerBound (f,RoundTol=>4);

        (bound,sol) = lowerBound (f,RoundTol=>12);
