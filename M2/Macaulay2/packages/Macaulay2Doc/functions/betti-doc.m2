    the class of all Betti tallies
  Description
    Text
      A Betti tally is a special type of @TO "Tally"@ that is printed as a display of graded Betti numbers.
      The class was created so the function @TO "betti"@ could return something that both prints nicely and
      from which information can be extracted.  The keys are triples @TT "(i,d,h)"@ encoding:
    Tree
      : @TT "i"@, the column labels, representing the homological degree;
      : @TT "d"@, a list of integers giving a multidegree; and
      : @TT "h"@, the row labels, representing the dot product of a weight covector and @TT "d"@.
    Text
      Only @TT "i"@ and @TT "h"@ are used in printing, and the weight covector can be modified by specifying
      the @TO [betti, Weights]@ option to @TO (betti, BettiTally)@.
    Example
      t = new BettiTally from { (0,{0},0) => 1, (1,{1},1) => 2, (2,{3},3) => 3, (2,{4},4) => 4 }
      betti(t, Weights => {2})
      peek oo
    Text
      For convenience, the operations of direct sum (@TO "++"@), tensor product (@TO "**"@), @TO codim@,
      @TO degree@, @TO dual@, @TO pdim@, @TO poincare@, @TO regularity@, and degree shifting (numbers in
      brackets or parentheses), have been implemented for Betti tallies.  These operations mimic the
      corresponding operations on chain complexes.
    Example
      t(5)
      t[-5]
      dual oo
      t ++ oo
      t ** t
      pdim t
      codim t
      degree t
      poincare t
      regularity t
    Text
      If the Betti tally represents the Betti numbers of a resolution of a module $M$ on a polynomial ring
      $R = K[x_0,...,x_n]$, then while the data does not uniquely determine $M$, it suffices to compute
      the @TO2 {hilbertPolynomial, "Hilbert polynomial"}@ and @TO2 {hilbertSeries, "Hilbert series"}@ of $M$.
    Example
      n = 3
      hilbertSeries(n, t)
      hilbertPolynomial(n, t)
    Text
      A Betti tally can be multiplied by an integer or by a rational number, and the values can be lifted
      to integers, when possible.
    Example
      (1/2) * t
      2 * oo
      lift(oo,ZZ)

    display or modify a Betti diagram
  Usage
    betti M
  Description
    Text
      The function @TT "betti"@ creates and displays the Betti diagram of mathematical objects that
      can be presented using graded free modules and graded maps between them, such as ideals, modules,
      and chain complexes. The returned @TO BettiTally@ encapsulates the data from the entries of the
      displayed Betti diagram, in case they are needed in a program.
    Example
      S = QQ[x,y,z,w];
      I = monomialCurveIdeal(S, {1,2,3})
      t = betti res I
      peek oo
      t#(1, {2}, 2)
    Text
      The keys are triples @TT "(i,d,h)"@ encoding:
    Tree
      : @TT "i"@, the column labels, representing the homological degree;
      : @TT "d"@, a list of integers giving a multidegree; and
      : @TT "h"@, the row labels, representing the dot product of a weight covector and @TT "d"@.
    Text
      Only @TT "i"@ and @TT "h"@ are used in printing, and the weight covector can be modified by specifying
      the @TO [betti, Weights]@ option. The @TO2 {"heft vectors", "heft vector"}@ of the ring of the input
      object is the default choice for the weight covector.
    Example
      R = QQ[a,b,c, Degrees => {-1,-2,-3}];
      heft R
      betti koszul vars R
    Text
      If the ring has no heft vector, then the weights vector is taken to be all zero.
      If the option @TO [betti, Weights]@ is provided, the length of the given weight vector should
      be the same as the @TO2 {degreeLength, "degree length"}@ of the ring of the input object.
    Example
      betti(oo, Weights => {1})
    Text
      If the ring is multigraded, the function @TO (multigraded, BettiTally)@ may be used to extract
      information from all degree components of the Betti diagram at once.
    Example
      R = QQ[a,b,c,d, Degrees => {{1,0},{2,1},{0,1},{-2,1}}];
      heft R
      B = betti res coker vars R

    the class of all multigraded Betti tallies
  Description
    Text
      A multigraded Betti tally is a special type of @TO BettiTally@ that is printed as a diagram of the
      multigraded Betti numbers. The class was created so that the method @TO (multigraded, BettiTally)@
      could return something that both prints nicely and from which information could be extracted. The
      content of a multigraded Betti tally is identical to the Betti tally from which it was constructed.
    Example
      B = new BettiTally from {(0, {0, 0}, 0) => 1, (1, {0, 2}, 2) => 1, (1, {1, 1}, 2) => 2, (1, {2, 0}, 2) => 1, (2, {1, 2}, 3) => 2, (2, {2, 1}, 3) => 2, (3, {2, 2}, 4) => 1}
      B = multigraded B
      peek B
    Text
      By default the data is presented as a table of polynomials where each column corresponds to a given
      homological degree appearing as the top entry and each monomial in the other entries represents the
      multidegree of a given summand.

      When @TO "compactMatrixForm"@ is set to @TT "false"@, the entries represent the multidegree of summands
      ordered by the total weight. The number of summands corresponding to a given multidegree appears to the
      left of the multidegree.
    Example
      compactMatrixForm = false
      B
    Text
      For convenience, various operations on @TT "BettiTally"@ such as direct sum (@TO "++"@), tensor product
      (@TO "**"@), @TO "pdim"@ and degree shifting (numbers in brackets or parentheses) are extended to work
      with multigraded Betti tables. These operations mimic the corresponding operations on chain complexes.
    Example
      compactMatrixForm = true
      B(-1,-1)
      B[1]
      B[1] ++ B
      B ** B
      compactMatrixForm = false
      B ** B

      A multigraded Betti tally is a special type of @TO "BettiTally"@ that both prints nicely and

    Example

      By changing the weights, we can reorder the columns of the diagram. The following three displays show
      the first degree, the second degree, and the total degree, respectively.
