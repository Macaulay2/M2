     Gröbner basis, as a matrix
   Usage

     I:Ideal
       or a module or a matrix (in which case the result is the Gröbner basis of the submodule
         generated by the columns)
     Strategy => String

       or "F4", and the result is experimental
     "MGBOptions" => List
       For internal use only.  Warning: the interface is likely to change.
   Outputs
     M:Matrix
       The matrix whose columns are the generators of the Gröbner basis of {\tt I}.
       In the non-local monomial order case, the result is auto-reduced, and sorted.
   Description
    Text
      With no {\tt Strategy} option, this just calls @TO "gb"@.
    Example
      R = QQ[a..d]
      M = groebnerBasis random(R^1,R^{4:-2});
      netList (ideal M)_*
    Text
      With a {\tt Strategy} option, the code is experimental, subject to
      interface changes, and might have bugs.  So use at your own
      risk!  However, it appears to work correctly and is often very
      fast, in cases where it applies.  If you encounter any bugs,
      please let us know!

      If either {\tt "MGB"} (MGB stands for mathicGB, the name of the package used),
      or {\tt "F4"} is given for the Strategy, then 
      experimental code (written by Bjarke Roune and M. Stillman) is used.
      The plan is for this to become the default version for Gröbner bases in later
      versions of Macaulay2.  But for now, it is experimental.
      
      These strategies only work for ideals in polynomial rings over a finite field ZZ/p.
      In other cases, either an error will be given, or the current default Gröbner
      basis algorithm will be used.
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[a..e]
      I = ideal sub(random(R^1, R^{4:-2}), e=>1);
      netList I_*
      gbI = ideal groebnerBasis(I, Strategy=>"MGB");
      netList gbI_*
    Text
      Also implemented is a Faugere-like algorithm that is sometimes much faster
      (but also sometimes takes a large amount of memory).
    Example
      gbTrace=1
      gbI = ideal groebnerBasis(I, Strategy=>"F4");
      netList gbI_*
   Caveat
     (1) The MGB and F4 options are experimental, work only over a finite field of char $< 2^{32}$, not over
     quotient rings, and not over exterior or Weyl algebras.  However, these versions can be much
     faster when they apply. (2) The experimental versions do not stash their results into the ideal
     or module. (3) The experimental version only works for ideals currently.
