  Key
    (apply, Thing, Function)
  Headline
    apply a function to an object with an iterator
  Usage
    apply(x, f)
  Inputs
    x:Thing -- an instance of a class with the @TO iterator@ method installed
    f:Function
  Outputs
    :Iterator
  Description
    Text
      Suppose @TT "x"@ is an instance of a class with the @TO iterator@ method
      installed, e.g., a string, and suppose @TT "iter"@ is the output of
      @TT "iterator x"@.  Then a new @TO Iterator@ object is returned whose
      @TO next@ method returns @TT "f next iter"@  until @TT "next iter"@
      returns @TO StopIteration@, in which case this new iterator does the same.
    Example
      applyiter = apply("foo", toUpper)
      next applyiter
      next applyiter
      next applyiter
      next applyiter
