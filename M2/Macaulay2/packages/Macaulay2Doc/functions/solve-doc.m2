   Headline
     solve linear equation(s)
   Usage
     X = solve(A,B)
   Inputs
     A:Matrix
       or @ofClass MutableMatrix@, of size m by n over a field R, which can be
       one of: ZZ/p, GF(p^n), QQ, RR, or CC
     B:
       of the same type of matrix as {\tt A}, over the same ring, of size m by r
     ClosestFit => Boolean 
       whether to use the least squares method, in the case when the ring is {\tt RR} or {\tt CC}
     MaximalRank => Boolean 
       declares to the system that the matrix is full rank.  In some cases, this can dramatically
       speed up the computation.  If the matrix is not full rank, then the results are potentially 
       meaningless.
   Outputs
     X:
       of the same type of matrix as {\tt A}, over the same ring, such that $AX=B$
   Description
     Example
       kk = ZZ/101;
       A = matrix"1,2,3,4;1,3,6,10;19,7,11,13" ** kk
       b = matrix"1;1;1" ** kk
       x = solve(A,b)
       A*x-b
     Example
       kk = GF(25)
       a = kk_0
       A = matrix"a,a+1,a+2,3a,4;a-1,1,2a,6,10;19,7,a,11,13" ** kk
       b = matrix"1;-a+1;1" ** kk
       x = solve(A,b)
       A*x-b
     Example
       kk = QQ
       A = matrix"1,2,3,4;1,3,6,10;19,7,11,13" ** kk
       b = matrix"1;1;1" ** kk
       x = solve(A,b)
       A*x-b
     Text

       Over {\tt RR_{53}} or {\tt CC_{53}}, if the matrix A is non-singular and square, 
       then highly optimized lapack routines will be called.

     Example
       printingPrecision = 4;
       A = matrix "1,2,3;1,3,6;19,7,11" ** RR
       b = matrix "1;1;1" ** RR
       x = solve(A,b)
       A*x-b
       norm oo
       clean(1e-15, A*x-b)
     Text

       If you know that your matrix is square, and invertible, then providing the
       hint: MaximalRank=>true allows Macaulay2 to choose the fastest routines.  For
       small matrix sizes, it should not be too noticeable, but for large matrices, the
       difference in time taken can be dramatic.

     Example
       printingPrecision = 4;
       N = 40
       A = mutableMatrix(CC_53, N, N); fillMatrix A;
       B = mutableMatrix(CC_53, N, 2); fillMatrix B;
       time X = solve(A,B);
       time X = solve(A,B, MaximalRank=>true);
       norm(A*X-B)
     Text

       Over higher precision RR or CC, these routines will be much slower than
       the lower precision lapack routines.

     Example
       N = 100
       A = mutableMatrix(CC_100, N, N); fillMatrix A;
       B = mutableMatrix(CC_100, N, 2); fillMatrix B;
       time X = solve(A,B);
       time X = solve(A,B, MaximalRank=>true);
       norm(A*X-B)
     Text

       Giving the option ClosestFit=>true, in the case when the field is RR or CC, 
       uses a least squares algorithm to find a best fit solution.

     Example
       kk = RR_53;
       A = matrix"1,2,3,4;1,3,6,10;19,7,11,13" ** kk
       b = matrix"1;1;1" ** kk
       x1 = solve(A,b, ClosestFit=>true)
       A*x1-b
     Text

       Giving both options ClosestFit and MaximalRank allows Macaulay2 to call
       a faster algorithm.

     Example
       x2 = solve(A,b, ClosestFit=>true, MaximalRank=>true)
       A*x2-b
   Caveat
     (1) This function is limited in scope, but has been designed to be much faster than
     generic algorithms.
     (2) If the matrix is a square invertible matrix, giving the option MaximalRank=>true can 
     strongly speed up the computation. 
     (3) For mutable matrices, this function is only currently implemented for densely encoded matrices.
