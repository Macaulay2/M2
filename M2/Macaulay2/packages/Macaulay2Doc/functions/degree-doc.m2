Key
  (length, Module)
Headline
  Computes the length of a module
Usage
  l = length M
Inputs
  M: Module
Outputs
  l: ZZ
    the length of M
Description
  Text
    If M is a graded module over a singly graded polynomal ring or a quotient of a
    polynomial ring over a field k then length is the same as the degree.

    If M is over a local ring then length is computed by summing the output of
    the Hilbert-Samuel function until it vanishes. Note that in this case the
    @TO "LocalRings :: LocalRings"@ package must be loaded first.
Consequences
  Item
    In the local case, the length of the module is stored in M.cache.length.
Caveat
  In the local case, the input is assumed to have finite length.
