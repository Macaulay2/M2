     TEST
    (TEST, String)
    (TEST, List)
  Headline
    add a test for a package
  Usage
    TEST s
  Inputs
    s:String
      or list of strings, containing Macaulay2 code
  Consequences
    Item
      registers the string @TT "s"@ as a test of the @TO2 {"currentPackage", "current package"}@.
  Description
    Text
      This function should only occur in the documentation section of a package; i.e., after @TO beginDocumentation@.
      Use @TO check@ to run all of the tests associated to a package.

      For an example, see @TO "SimpleDoc :: docExample"@ and @TO "an example of a package"@.
  Caveat
    When creating tests, try to ensure that they run relatively quickly.

  Headline
    perform tests of a package
  Usage
    check pkg
    check(i, pkg)
  Inputs
    pkg:Package
      or String, the package to test
    i:ZZ
      the index of the test to run or -1 to run all tests
    UserMode=>Boolean
      if true, do not use the @TT "-q"@ in arguments to the Macaulay2 executable when running tests,
      thereby allowing it to load the user's @TO "initialization file"@, allowing it to load packages
      previously installed in the user's @TO2 {"applicationDirectory", "application directory"}@
      and allowing packages it loads to read their configuration files from the user's
      @TO2 {"applicationDirectory", "application directory"}@. If false, the @TT "-q"@ argument is added.
      If @TO "null"@, then add @TT "-q"@ if it appears as an option in @TO "commandLine"@.
    Verbose=>Boolean
      if true, then print the output of all failing tests
  Consequences
    Item
      the tests in the package @TT "pkg"@ are run (in separate Macaulay2 processes, with the random number
      seed initialized to 0), and any errors are reported.
    Item
      if @TT "i"@ is given, only the i-th test in the package is run and any errors are reported.
  Description
    Text
      It is important for package authors to provide tests to ensure that the package is functioning properly.
      One provides tests using the @TO TEST@ function following the @TO beginDocumentation@ call in the source
      of the package.

      Optionally, one can store all tests in a @TT "tests.m2"@ directory under the auxiliary subdirectory of
      the package and load the file from the main package source file.

      For example, to run the tests for the @TO "LLLBases :: LLLBases"@ package (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz bases), use:
    CannedExample
      needsPackage "LLLBases"
      check_1 LLLBases
      check LLLBases
    Text
      Alternatively, if the package is installed somewhere accessible, one can do the following.
    CannedExample
      check_1 "LLLBases"
      check "LLLBases"
  Caveat
    Currently, if the package was only partially loaded because the documentation was
    obtainable from a database (see @TO "beginDocumentation"@), then the package will be reloaded,
    this time completely, to ensure that all tests are considered; this may affect user objects
    of types declared by the package, as they may be not usable by the new instance of the
    package. In a future version, either the tests and the documentation will both be cached, or neither will.
