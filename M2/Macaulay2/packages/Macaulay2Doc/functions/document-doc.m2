  Description
    Text
      There are two basic types of documentation:

      @OL {
          {"Documenting a function or a method, as in ", TO (resolution, Module), "."},
          {"documenting an overview or functions with methods, as in ", TO "chain complexes",
              " or ", TO resolution, " respectively."}}@

      The headings @TO Usage@, @TO BaseFunction@, @TO Inputs@, @TO Outputs@, and @TO Consequences@,
      are useful only for documentation of the first type, as well as in a call to @TO SYNOPSIS@.

Node
  Key
    Key
    [document, Key]
  Headline
    key of a documentation node
  Usage
    document { Key => key, ... }
  Consequences
    Item
      specifies the name under which the documentation is stored
  Description
    Text
      The document key is the name of the node, specifically the one that allows users to find the
      documentation for the desired command. Some node names, rather than being strings, are sequences
      of Macaulay2 objects that refer to specific method functions. If one is documenting a function of
      Macaulay2, the key will just be the function's name, as in the documentation for @TO resolution@.
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Key => {resolution}//// }

    Text
      However, if one is documenting a method for a function, then the key will have
      a different form, as in the documentation for @TO (resolution, Module)@.
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Key => {(resolution, Module)}//// }

    Text
      If one is documenting an optional argument to a function, then the key
      has a different form still, as in @TO [resolution, SyzygyLimit]@.
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Key => {[resolution, SyzygyLimit]}//// }

    Text
      Finally, if one is documenting an overview of a group of functions or a package,
      as in @TO "chain complexes"@ then one would set up a document key of the form:
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Key => {"chain complexes"}//// }
  Caveat
    No two documentation nodes may have the same key or even a key that is a synonym for a key which is already used.
    However, sometimes there is a need for several documentation nodes to have the same key. This happens when a
    command that needs to be documented is a synonym for another already documented command. In this case the
    synonym's key should be stated in quotation marks.
    As an example, look at the documentation for @TO "Text :: SUBSECTION"@ and @TO "Text :: HEADER2"@ in
    @HREF { currentLayout#"packages" | "Text.m2", "Text.m2" }@.

  Consequences
    Item
      the headline string will be used to annotate itemized lists of cross-references to the documentation @TO "Key"@

Node
  Key
    Usage
    [document, Usage]
  Headline
    ways to use a function in a documentation node
  Usage
    document { ... , Usage => "usage", ... }
  Description
    Text
      The @TT "Usage"@ entry should give a formal example showing the usage of the function.
      The variables used in this formal example should be the ones used in the @TO "Inputs"@ and @TO "Outputs"@
      sections of the documentation. Here is the code for the @TT "Usage"@ entry of the method @TO (matrix, List)@:
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Usage => "matrix v"//// }
    Text
      Here is the code for the @TT "Usage"@ entry of the method @TO (resolution, Module)@:
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Usage => "resolution M\nres M"//// }
    Text
      This option also can be used within a @TO SYNOPSIS@ section.

    Inputs
    [document, Inputs]
  Headline
    inputs for a function in a documentation node
  Usage
    document { ... , Inputs => { inputs, ... }, ... }
  Description
    Text
      The entries should consist of items in one of the following forms.

      @UL {
          TT "hypertext",
          TT "class",
          TT "symbolname",
          TT "class => hypertext",
          TT "symbolname => class",
          TT "symbolname => hypertext",
          TT "symbolname => class => hypertext",
          }@

      As an example, here is the @TT "Inputs"@ entry of the method @TO (resolution, Ideal)@:
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Inputs => { "I" => { "an ideal in a ring ", TT "R", ", say" } }//// }
    Text
      Here is an example of the @TT "Inputs"@ entry of the function @TO sin@:
    Code

Node
  Key
    Outputs
    [document, Outputs]
  Headline
    outputs for a function in a documentation node
  Usage
    document { ... , Outputs => { outputs, ... }, ... }
  Description
    Text
      The entries should consist of items in one of the following forms.

      @UL {
          TT "hypertext",
          TT "class => hypertext (or null)",
          TT "symbolname => hypertext (or null)",
          TT "symbolname => class => hypertext (or null)",
          }@

      As an example, here is the @TT "Outputs"@ entry of the method @TO ( resolution,Ideal)@:
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Outputs => { {"a resolution of ", TT "R/I", " by projective ", TT "R", "-modules" } }//// }
    Text
      Note that the hypertext list needs to be bounded by @TT "{"@ and @TT "}"@ as there is only one output for
      @TO (resolution, Ideal)@. Without the braces, multiple outputs are defined. Note also that the @TO Type@ of
      the output is automatically added in this case.

      Here is an example of the @TT "Outputs"@ entry of the function @TO sin@:
    Code
      EXAMPLE { PRE ////Outputs => { { "the sine of ", TT "x", "" } }//// }
