  Description
    Text
      The documentation for Macaulay2 is available in several formats and can
      be searched and viewed using the following functions:

    Tree
      :Finding documentation nodes
        about
	apropos
      :Accessing documentation nodes
        help
	viewHelp
	infoHelp
	(symbol?, Symbol)
      :Getting other information from documentaiton
        examples

    Text
      To begin, the @TO "about"@ method allows for searching all documentation nodes
      whose title or content contains a given string:
    Example
      about "Horrocks-Mumford"
    Text
      The @TO "apropos"@ method is useful for finding all exported objects whose symbol
      matches the given regular expression:
    Example
      apropos "(H|h)ilbert"
    Text
      While in Macaulay2, type @TO "help"@ to get the documentation on a topic or function,
      or type @TO "viewHelp"@ to open @TT "~/.Macaulay2/index.html"@, which contains a list
      of all installed packages, in your default web browser.

      For help on a specific topic, e.g., the Jacobian function, use @TT "viewHelp jacobian"@
      or @TT "viewHelp \"jacobian\""@, or if you want the documentation for Jacobian of an
      Ideal, use @TT "viewHelp (jacobian, Ideal)"@ or @TT "viewHelp \"jacobian(Ideal)\""@.
      Using @TO "help"@ instead of @TO "viewHelp"@ results in the help text appearing
      in your Macaulay2 session.

      @BOLD "A useful tip:"@ within Emacs, if you place your cursor on one of the resulting
      output lines that starts with a @TT "*"@, and press the return key, Macaulay2 will
      display that documentation node.

      The documentation for most functions comes with example code.
      You can obtain the text of this example code using @TO "examples"@.
