  Task
 Description
  Text
    The task system schedules functions and inputs to run on a preset number of
    threads. The number of threads to be used is given by the variable
    @ TO "allowableThreads" @, and may be examined and changed as follows.
  Example
       allowableThreads
       allowableThreads = 4
  Text
    To run a function in another thread use @ TO schedule @, as in the
    following example.
  Example
       R = ZZ/101[x,y,z];
       I = (ideal vars R)^2
       dogb = I -> () -> res quotient module I
       f = dogb I
       t = schedule f
  Text
    Note that @ TO schedule @ returns a task, not the result of the computation,
    which will be accessible only after the task has completed the computation.
  Example
       t
  Text
    Use @ TO isReady @ to check whether the result is available yet.
  Example
       isReady t
       while not isReady t do sleep 1
  Text
    To retrieve the result, use @ TO taskResult @.
  Example
       taskResult t
       assert instance(oo,ChainComplex)
  Text
    It is possible to make a task without starting it running, using @ TO createTask @.
  Example
       t' = createTask f
       t'
  Text
    Start it running with @ TO schedule @.
  Example
       schedule t';
       t'
       while not isReady t' do sleep 1
       taskResult t'
  Text
    One may use @ TO addStartTask @ to specify that one task is to be started after another
    one finishes.  In the following example, {\tt G} will start after {\tt F} finishes.
  Example
       F = createTask(() -> "result of F")
       G = createTask(() -> "result of G")
       addStartTask(F,G)
       schedule F
       while not isReady F do sleep 1
       taskResult F
       while not isReady G do sleep 1
       taskResult G
  Text
    Use @ TO addCancelTask @ to specify that the completion of one task triggers the cancellation
    of another, by means of an interrupt exception.
    
    Use @ TO addDependencyTask @ to schedule a task, but to ensure that it will not run until one or more
    other tasks finish running.
    
    Using the functions above, essentially any parallel functionality needed can be created. 
    
    Low level C API functionality using the same scheduler also exists in the
    Macaulay2/system directory. It works essentially the same way as the
    Macaulay2 interface.

    Warning: Access to external libraries such as singular, etc., may not
    currently be thread safe.

  addCancelTask
 Headline
  specify that the completion of one task triggers the cancellation of another
 Usage
  addCancelTask(t,u)
 Inputs
  t:Task
  u:Task
 Consequences
  Item
   when the task {\tt t} is finished, then the task {\tt u} will be cancelled
Node
 Key
  (cancelTask,Task)
  cancelTask
 Headline
  stop a task
 Usage
  cancelTask t
 Inputs
  t:
 Consequences
  Item
   The task {\tt t} is interrupted by setting a flag.  Eventually it will stop.

  Example
   n = 0
   t = schedule(() -> while true do n = n+1)
   sleep 1

  schedule
  (schedule,Function)
  (schedule,Function,Thing)
  (schedule,Task)
 Headline
  schedule a task for execution
 Usage
  schedule(f,x)
  schedule f
  schedule t
 Inputs
  f:Function
  x:Thing
  t:Task
 Outputs
  :
   a new task computing the value of the {\tt f(x)}, or, if {\tt x} is not provided, then of {\tt f()}.
   Alternatively, the task {\tt t}, created previously with @ TO createTask @, is sheduled for execution.
 Description
  Text
   The computation proceeds in the background, in a thread.  The status of the task can be observed
   by printing {\tt t}.  When the computation is finished, as can be detected with @ TO (isReady,Task) @,
   the final value can be retrieved with @ TO (taskResult,Task) @.
   
   If @ TO "notify" @ is set to @ TO true @, then useful messages are printed when the task changes state.
  Example
   f = x -> 2^x
   t = createTask(f,3)
   schedule t
   while not isReady t do sleep 1
   taskResult t
   u = schedule(f,4)
   while not isReady u do sleep 1
   taskResult u

  taskResult
 Headline
  retrieve the value returned by a task
 Usage
  taskResult t
 Inputs
  t:
 Outputs
  :
   the value returned by the function provided to @ TO (schedule,Function) @ when the task was started,
   provided it is ready (done), as determined by @ TO (isReady, Task) @.  If the task is not ready,
   an error will be signaled.
 Consequences
  Item
   The field in {\tt t} where the return value is stored is set to @ TO null @, and the task is
   considered to have completely terminated.  Attempting to fetch the return value a second time
   will signal an error.

  "allowableThreads"
 Headline
  the current maximum number of simultaneously running tasks
 Usage
  allowableThreads = n
 Consequences
  Item
   The number of threads devoted to computation of tasks is set to {\tt n}.  The
   number includes the main thread, but not the threads started independently by
   the garbage collector.  Thus the maximum number of background tasks running simultaneously
   will be {\tt n-1}.  The value of {\tt n} should be not larger than the value
   of @ TO "maxAllowableThreads" @.
