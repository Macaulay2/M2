-- Given a variety $X$ in projective
-- $r$-space $\PP^r$, the Fano scheme
-- $Fano_k(X)$ is the natural parameter 
-- space for the linear $k$-planes
-- lying on $X$.  In this tutorial we explore
-- the methods for computing it. The tutorial
-- is in three parts
--
--
-- A. The twenty-seven lines
--
-- B. General methods
--
-- C. Surfaces of degree $4$ in $\PP^5$
--
-- In section A, we treat by hand the Fano
-- variety of lines on a nonsingular cubic
-- surface in $\PP^3$, and find that there are
-- indeed $27$ lines lying on the surface.
--
-- In section B, we explain a general purpose
-- function, written to compute Fano schemes.
--
-- There are (up to linear transformations) just
-- $3$ nondegenerate smooth surfaces 
-- of degree $4$ in $\PP^5$: the Veronese embedding
-- of $\PP^2$ and the rational normal scrolls
-- $S(1,3)$ and $S(2,2)$.  Can they be distinguished
-- by their Fano varieties of lines?  
-- To find out, read section C!

-----------------------------------------------
-- A. Lines on the nonsingular cubic in $\PP^3$
-----------------------------------------------
-- First make the homogeneous coordinate
-- ring of the ambient projective $3$-space
R = ZZ/32003[a,b,c,d]

-- and the ideal of a nonsingular cubic
X = ideal(a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3)

-- We make a parametrized indeterminate line in 
-- our projective space, adding parameters $s,t$
-- for the line and two points $p_0..p_3$ and
-- $q_0..q_3$ representing the points 0 and infinity
-- on the line. 

KK = coefficientRing R 

S = KK [s,t,p_0..p_3,q_0..q_3]

-- Then we make a map $F$ from $R$ to the new ring
-- sending the variables to the coordinates
-- of the general point on the line

--^
F = map(S,R,
       s*matrix{{p_0..p_3}} +
       t*matrix{{q_0..q_3}}
       )
--$
-- We now apply $F$ to the ideal of $X$
FX = F X
-- and the condition we want becomes the condition
-- that {\tt FX} vanishes identically in $s,t$.
-- The following line produces the coefficients:
cFX = last coefficients(gens FX, Variables => {s,t})

-- The interface to the {\tt coefficients} routine is a bit
-- baroque, and might change in the future.  For now,
-- the $\{0,1\}$ says to find the coefficients of each column 
-- of the matrix, with respect to the first two variables.
-- The routine returns a list of two matrices, the
-- second one being the one we need (index 1, since
-- all indices start at 0 in Macaulay2)
--
-- We can get rid of some of the variables of $S$,
-- to ease the computation:

S1 = KK[p_0..p_3,q_0..q_3]
cFX = substitute(cFX, S1)

-- The ring we want is the quotient

S1bar = S1/ideal cFX

-- Now we want to move to the Grassmannian,
-- so we take a new polynomial ring in 6 variables
-- that will correspond to the minors of the
-- matrix with rows $p_0..p_3$ and $q_0..q_3$,

GR = coefficientRing R[x_0..x_5]

-- We define a map sending the $x_i$ to the minors,
-- regarded as elements of S1bar
--^
M = substitute(
    exteriorPower(2, matrix{{p_0..p_3},{q_0..q_3}}),
    S1bar)
--$
gr = map (S1bar, GR, M)
fano = trim ker gr

-- {\tt trim} replaces the given set of generators
-- with a minimal set of generators.
-- We get an ideal representing points:
codim fano
-- and the number of these points -- the number
-- of the corresponding lines - is 27:
degree fano

-- It is interesting to note 
-- that the ideal of the
-- Fano scheme that we have produced is NOT
-- saturated, as the number (25) of cubics it
-- contains is less than $56 - 27 = 29$:
betti fano

-- Possible next steps in this computation would
-- be to compute the Jacobian ideal of Fano to
-- show that we really got 27 distinct lines, etc.

---------------------------------------------
-- B. General methods
---------------------------------------------
--    The first step in writing a program is to 
-- decide what the program should do, and it
-- is just as well to write the documentation
-- at this point .
--
-- The documentation has the following form.

degree I

MVero = genericSymmetricMatrix(P5,a,3)
Vero = minors(2,MVero)
        
-- The other scrolls are defined by the minors

-- ``catalecticant'' blocks, that is, from
-- matrices such as
-- $$\begin{pmatrix}b & c & d & e \\
--             c & d & e & f \end{pmatrix}$$
-- which are manufactured by

--^
catalecticant = (R,v,m,n) -> 
        map(R^m,n,(i,j)-> R_(i+j+v))
--$
-- for example
catalecticant(P5,1,2,4)
-- produces the example above.

-- The rational normal scroll {\tt S13}, which is
-- the union of lines joining a line with
-- the corresponding points of a twisted cubic
-- in a disjoint subspace of $\PP^5$

--^
M13 = catalecticant(P5,0,2,1) |
           catalecticant(P5,2,2,3)
--$
S13 = minors(2,M13)

-- Finally, the rational normal scroll {\tt S22},
-- which is made by a similar construction 
-- starting with two conics in $\PP^5$

--
M22 = catalecticant(P5,0,2,2) | catalecticant(P5,3,2,2)
--
S22 = minors(2, M22)
      
-- It is interesting to note that the numerical
-- invariants of these surfaces are very hard
-- to distinguish.  In particular, the graded
-- betti numbers

Verores = res coker gens Vero
S22res = res coker gens S22
S13res = res coker gens S13
betti Verores
betti S22res
betti S13res

-- coincide, so the three cannot be distinguished
-- on the basis of these or on the basis of 
-- the (weaker) invariants the Hilbert series
-- or Hilbert polynomials. But the Fano
-- varieties are more obviously different:
--
-- We compute the Fano varieties of lines
-- on each of our surfaces.

FVero = Fano2(1, Vero)
betti gens FVero
-- The ideal contains all $120$ quadrics,
-- and represents the empty set:  The
-- Veronese surface contains no lines!

FS13 = Fano2(1, S13)

-- It turns out that the dimension (1) and 
-- degree (4) of these varieties coincide!
-- Moreover, since the ideals are not saturated,
-- one cannot directly compare the Hilbert
-- series or free resolutions (of course
-- one could first compute a saturation).
-- But there is the arithmetic genus,
-- that is, $1-H(0)$, where $H$ is the Hilbert
-- polynomial.  

hilbertPolynomial coker gens FS13

-- The output, $4 \PP^1 - 2 \PP^0$, means ``four times the
-- Hilbert polynomial of the projective line
-- minus 2''; that is, the polynomial is 
-- $H(d) = 4d + 2$; so arithmetic genus is $-1$.

FS22 = Fano2(1, S22)
hilbertPolynomial coker gens FS22

-- The output, $4 \PP^1 - 3 \PP^0$, means $H(d) = 4d + 1$,
-- arithmetic genus $-1$.

-- In fact, the Fano variety of {\tt S22} consists of
-- a projective line, embedded as a smooth
-- rational quartic; 
-- while the Fano variety of {\tt S13} consists of 
-- a smooth rational quartic (corresponding to
-- the rulings of the surface {\tt S13} and an
-- isolated point, corresponding to the section
-- of negative self-intersection on the surface).
