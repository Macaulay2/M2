 Here's what to do when rewriting a basic documentation node:

  Update your files using "cvs update" before starting.

 Look in M2doc/Macaualay2/functions for the command you are working on
   and open up the file <command>-doc.m2.

 Put your name on top.

 If there is old documentation, then the name of the doc#.m2 file will
   show up at the bottom of the file. If so, go find it in
   M2doc/Macaulay2/doc#.m2 and move the code to the new file and delete 
   the lines from the doc#.m2 file.

 Go to functions.m2 and uncomment the file you are working on, so it
   gets loaded.
 
 Now edit the file you are working on:
   If there is old documentation, put it into the new format and delete
     the old stuff.
   If there is a test in the doc#.m2 file, move it to the end of the
     new file
   If it has a command that refers to it, try to combine them, unless 
     they're really different and need different examples/explanation
     for each. 
   Remove any sections of the automatically generated file that are not
     being used.

   See form of compress-doc.m2 or pdim-doc.m2 for simple examples.

   Note:  Don't forget to use ";" to suppress irrelevant output in examples.
	  Separate lines of example by commas. Don't forget to use 
            quotes around each line.
	  Should probably have some text before each example explaining
	    it. 
	  There will automatically be inserted spaces before/after 
	    examples or something like this, so don't try to add 
	    in the node page. 

 When done, change the status from TODO to DRAFT.
   (After review, it will become "REVIEWED")
   (When accepted, the status line will disappear.)

 Then run "installPackage Macaulay2" in M2. Fix any errors that occur
   and rerun installPackage. (can use the option RemakeAllDocumentation=>true)

   Note: Cntrl-<up arrow> allows you to see the history of commands in
     M2 within emacs

 Look at your local documentation to see how it looks. 
   Note: It will not change the other pages that refer to this node.
         To change these, need to set RemakeA11Documentation=>true
           when run installPackage.

 Finally go to shell and make sure you're in M2doc/Macaulay2. Run CVS
   by typing:
     cvs ci -m "some identifier here about what you did"
   to log in your changes.

 Recall: to update your local versions of things type:
     cvs update



Some useful commands:
...", TT "...  will change the font of the following string to typewriter
TO "<linkname>"
TO2(<link name>, <link text>)
...", PARA, "...   starts a new paragraph in the text
