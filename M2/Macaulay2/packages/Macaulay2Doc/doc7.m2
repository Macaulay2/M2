       or @ofClass Module@, the $i$-th symmetric power of the matrix or module $f$
   Description
    Text
      There is currently one restriction: if $f$ is a matrix, then it must have only one row,
      and be a map of free modules, as in this example.
    Example
      R = ZZ/101[a..d]
      symmetricPower(2,vars R)
    Text
      If G --> F --> M --> 0 is a presentation for the module M = coker(f:G-->F), 
      then symmetricPower(i,f) is the cokernel of the map 
      symmetricPower(i-1,F) ** G --> symmetricPower(i,F).

      R = ZZ/101[a,b]
