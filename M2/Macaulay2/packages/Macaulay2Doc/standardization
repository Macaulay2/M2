Some issues which should be resolved in a standard manner:

Do not use a period at the end of an input or output, but use a period
anytime there is a sentence.

If the description is just an example, then do not put anything like
"Example:" or "Here is an example." before the EXAMPLE{} 

Make sure your examples run and are correct!! :-)

Suppress output in an example if it repeats the input. 

There should be only full sentences in the description. 

Use PARA between separate examples, but not between a sentence and the
M2 code related to that sentence.

Note: if the only think present is an example, then the title of the
section "Description" will be automatically changed to "Example".

If the description of the output is very short, put it in the
"outputs" area. If it is not so short, then put it in the
"Description" area.
