     The default (GRevLex) monomial ordering in polynomial rings whose

     The implementation of the Gr√∂bner basis algorithm for polynomial rings
     where the multidegrees of the variables don't all have strictly positive
     first component has been fixed by having it use the heft vector provided.
     The problem was that bases were not minimalized, and S-pairs were
