    Macaulay2 packages
  Description
    Text
      A package is a body of Macaulay2 source code devoted to a particular topic.
      Many packages are distributed with Macaulay2, and others are available from
      the author's homepage.

      To load a package, say @TT "FirstPackage"@, enter:
    Pre
      loadPackage "FirstPackage"
    Text
      or
    Pre
      needsPackage "FirstPackage"
    Text
      For technical information about packages, see @TO Package@.

      Macaulay2 searches for the file @TT "FirstPackage.m2"@ on your search @TO "path"@.
      The packages provided with Macaulay2 are on your search path, as is your current
      working directory.

  Description
    Text
      Creating a package is the most common way of contributing to Macaulay2. Packages can contain
      code for working with objects of a certain category, generating examples for testing a conjecture,
      or an implemention of algorithms introduced in the literature.

    Tree
      :There are five parts to a Macaulay2 package
        :the preamble, initiated by @TO newPackage@
        :a list of exported functions and variables, set via @TO export@ and @TO exportMutable@
        :the code that constitutes the package
        :the documentation for the package, which comes after @TO beginDocumentation@
        :a number of tests for the new package, added using @TO TEST@

    Text
      See @TO "an example of a package"@ for the basic template for new packages, or
      @TO "SimpleDoc :: packageTemplate"@ for a utility for generating the skeleton for a new package.

      The name of the package must be the name of the file, without the @TT ".m2"@ suffix.
      Thus a package @TT "NewMath"@ will be in a file named @TT "NewMath.m2"@.
      Other sources required by the package may be stored in a subdirectory named @TT "NewMath"@
      located in the same directory as the package.
    Text
      @HEADER3 "Documenting and testing a package"@

      The documentation and tests included in a package inform others about how to use your package
      and ensure that your package continues to work with future versions of Macaulay2.
      See @TO "writing documentation"@ for more information.
    Text
      @HEADER3 "Distributing a package"@

      To add your package to the list of packages distributed with Macaulay2, authors can submit their package via a
      @HREF {"https://github.com/Macaulay2/M2/pulls", "pull request to the GitHub repository for Macaulay2"}@.

      Before submitting your package, use the @TO installPackage@ and @TO check@ functions to ensure
      there are no errors in the package documentation and that all the tests pass.
