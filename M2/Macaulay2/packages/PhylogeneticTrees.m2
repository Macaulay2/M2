	PhylogeneticTrees
    Headline
        a package to compute phylogenetic invariants associated to group-based models
    Description
        Text
	    {\em PhylogeneticTrees} is a package for phylogenetic algebraic geometry. This 
	    package calculates generating sets for phylogenetic ideals and their joins and 
	    secants.  Additionally, the package computes lower bounds for the dimensions 
	    of secants and joins of phylogenetic ideals. 
            
	    This package handles a class of commonly used tree-based Markov models called 
	    group-based models.  These models are subject to the Fourier-Hadamard coordinate 
	    transformation, which make the parametrizations monomial and the ideals toric. 
	    See the following for more details: [1] and [2].
	    	 
	    For these models, the PhylogeneticTrees package includes two methods for computing 
	    a generating set for ideals of phylogenetic invariants. The first  method calls 
	    @TO FourTiTwo@ to compute the generating set of the toric ideal. The second 
	    implements a theoretical construction for inductively determining the ideal of 
	    phylogenetic invariants for any $k$-valent tree from the $k$-leaf claw tree as 
	    described in Theorem 24 of [3].
            
	    This package also handles the joins and secants of these ideals by implementing 
	    the elimination method described in [4].
	    
	    In cases where computing a generating set for a join or secant ideal is infeasible, 
	    the package provides a probabilistic method, based on Terraciniâs Lemma, to compute 
	    a lower bound on the dimension of a join or secant ideal.

        Text
	    For models such as Jukes-Cantor (@TO "JCmodel"@) and Kimura 2-parameter (@TO "K2Pmodel"@),
	    multiple variables in the Fourier coordinates may map to the same monomial under the
	    monomial map that defines the toric variety of the model.  These equivalencies give rise
	    to linear relations in the space of Fourier coordinates.

	    The number of linear invariants is the codimension of the smallest linear subspace in
	    which the toric variety of the model is contained.

	    The optional argument @TO QRing@ can be passed the ring of Fourier coordinates.  Otherwise
	    the function will create a new ring.
        Example
	    T = leafTree(3,{})
	    S = qRing(T, K2Pmodel)

    Description
        Text
	    The quadratic invariants are also referred to as the edge invariants of the model.
	    
	    Each Fourier coordinate corresponds to a consistent coloring of the edges of tree {\tt T}.
	    For any given internal edge {\tt e} of {\tt T}, the consistent colorings can be obtained by
	    coloring two smaller graphs and gluing them along {\tt e}.  This corresponds to a fiber
	    product on the corresponding toric varieties. The quadratic invariants naturally
	    arise from this process by gluing a pair of colorings of one small graph to a pair of
	    colorings of the other small graph in two different ways.

	    The optional argument @TO QRing@ can be passed the ring of Fourier coordinates.  Otherwise
	    the function will create a new ring.

	a group-based model
    Description
        Text
	    A phylogenetic tree model on tree $T$ has outcomes that are described by assigning each leaf of the tree
	    any label from a particular set (typically the label set is the set of DNA bases, \{A,T,C,G\}).
	    The probability of a certain assignment of labels depends on transition probabilities between each ordered pair of labels.
	    These transition probabilities are the parameters of the model.

	    In a group based model, the label set is a group $G$ (typically $\mathbb{Z}/2$ or $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^2$), and the transition
	    probability for a pair $(g,h)$ depends only on $h-g$. This reduces the number of parameters from $|G|^2$ to $|G|$.
	    Depending on the model, further identifications of parameters are imposed.

            An object of class @TO Model@ stores the information about a group-based model required to
	    compute phylogenetic invariants.
	    This information includes the elements of the group, how those elements are partitioned, and a set of
	    automorphisms of the group that preserve the partitions.

	    There are four built-in models: Cavender-Farris-Neyman or binary model (@TO "CFNmodel"@); 
	    Jukes-Cantor model (@TO "JCmodel"@); Kimura 2-parameter model (@TO "K2Pmodel"@); 
	    and Kimura 3-parameter model (@TO "K3Pmodel"@).  Other models can be constructed with @TO model@.

	    Finally, for every ordered pair of group elements sharing a parameter, {\tt aut} must provide an automorphism of the group
	    that switches those two group elements.  In {\tt aut} all of the group elements are identified by their index in $G$,
	    and an automorphism is given by a list of permuted index values.

	    In our example, the pairs requiring an automorphism are {\tt \{2,3\}} and {\tt \{3,2\}}.

            An object of class @TO LeafTree@ is specified by listing its leaves, and for each internal edge, 
	    the partition the edge induces on the set of leaves.
	    {\tt L} is the set of leaves, or if an integer {\tt n} is input then the leaves will be be named $0,\ldots,n-1$.
	    {\tt E} is a list with one entry for each internal edge.
	    Each entry is a partition specified as a list or set of the leaves in one side of the partition.
	    Thus each edge can be specified in two possible ways.

	    An object of class @TO LeafTree@ can also be constructed from a @TO Graph@ provided the graph has no cycles.

	    Here we construct the quartet tree, which is the tree with 4 leaves and one internal edge.
