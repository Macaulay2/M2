    	Text
          This package implements the computations of classes in the
          Chow ring of a toric variety using tropical geometry.
          Part of this code is based on a package previously written by

    Compute the multiplicities of a refinement of a tropical variety
  Usage
    refineMultiplicity(T,X)
  Inputs
    T: TropicalCycle
    X: NormalToricVariety
      which fan refines T
  Outputs
    mult: List
      list of the multiplicities, indexed by cones of X of the same dimension of T
  Description
    Text
        This function calculate the multiplicities of a refinement of a tropical variety T.
        The output is a list of integers indexed by orbits(X,n-k), where k = dim T, n = dim X
        and X is the normal toric variety of the refinement.
    Example
        X = toricProjectiveSpace 3;
        R = QQ[x_1 .. x_3];
        f = x_1*x_2*x_3 + x_1*x_2 + x_1*x_3 + x_2*x_3;

  Usage

  Inputs

    mult: List

  Outputs
    prod: List
      list of intersection products
  Description
    Text
        The list mult is the list of multiplicities of the tropicalization of
        the intersection of a subvariety Y of X with the torus. The tropicalization has the fan
        structure of the fan of X', and k is the dimension of Y. This function calculates the intersection
        products of Y and V(sigma), where sigma is a cone of X of dimension k. This is done by calculating
        the pullback of V(sigma) in X', and substituting V(sigma') with m(sigma'), where sigma' is a cone
        of dimension k in X'. This is the same as taking the class in X' corresponding to the Minkowski weights
        given by Y and computing the Minkowski weights corresponding to the pushforward of this class on X.
    Example
        X = toricProjectiveSpace 3;
        R = QQ[x_1 .. x_3];
        f = x_1*x_2*x_3 + x_1*x_2 + x_1*x_3 + x_2*x_3;

  Description
    Text
        Given a hyperplane inside the torus, given by a linear ideal I, let X be a normal toric variety which fan
        is supported on the tropicalization of V(I). This function calculates a toric cycle which class is the same
        of a subvariety of V(I). The subvariety Y of V(I) is given by an ideal J such that Y = V(I+J), that is
        Y is the intersection of V(J) and V(I) inside the torus of X. The purpose of this function is
        essentially the same as classFromTropical, but it is optimized to this particular setting. Note that
        the closure of V(I) inside X is a wonderful compactification of V(I).
    Text
        It is possible to explicitly input the toric variety, and this allows to implicitly specify the building set
        of the wonderful compactification.
    Text
        A remarkable example among these is the moduli space of n-marked genus 0 curves M_0,n.
        Below, we use this function on M_0,6 to compute one of the 15 Keel-Vermeire divisors.
    Example
        R = QQ[x_0..x_8];
        I = ideal {-x_0+x_3+x_4, -x_1+x_3+x_5,-x_2+x_3+x_6, -x_0+x_2+x_7, -x_1+x_2+x_8, -x_0+x_1+1};
        X = normalToricVariety fan tropicalVariety I;

  Description

        This function calculates the ideal of the intersection of subavariety of a toric variety X

        inside the Laurent ring of the torus. The subvariety of X is given by its ideal in the Cox ring.
        It applies the isomorphism of the Laurent polynomials with the degree zero part
        of the localization with respect to the product of variables of the Cox ring.
