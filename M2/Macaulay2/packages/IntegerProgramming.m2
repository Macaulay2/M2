        solving integer programs with Gröbner bases
    
    Description
        Text
            Integer linear programming concerns optimization problems of the form 
            $$
            \begin{matrix}
                \text{minimize} & c^T x \\ 
                \text{such that} & Ax = b \\ 
                \text{and} & x \in \mathbb Z^n_{\ge 0}
            \end{matrix}
            $$
            for some $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and vectors $b$ and $c$.
            In general, solving integer linear programs is an NP-hard problem.
            Work from the early 1990s (see [CT, O, P]) developed algorithms for solving integer linear programs 
            using Gröbner bases.
            
            The key to this approach is constructing a term order that is compatible with the objective function 
            of the program.
            We implement this in @TO adaptedMonomialOrder@, which returns a ring equipped with such a term order.
            This order is used in @TO solveILP@ to solve integer programs.

    Description
        Text
            Solving integer linear programs using Gröbner bases relies on constructing a monomial order that is {\em adapted} to the program at hand.
            This method returns a ring equipped with such an order.

        Text
            {\bf Definition.}
            Fix a matrix $A \in \mathbb Z^{m \times n}$ and vectors $b \in \mathbb Z^m$, $c \in \mathbb Z^n$.
            Consider the integer linear program in @TO2 {toStandardForm, "standard form"}@: 
            $$\text{minimize } c^Tx \quad \text{subject to } Ax = b \text{ and } x \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^n.$$
            Let $\varphi$ be as in @TO isFeasiblePoint@.
            A monomial order $<$ on $k[z_1, \ldots, z_m, w_1, \ldots, w_n]$ is {\em adapted} to the program if both of the following hold:

            1. (Elimination) $z_i > w^\alpha$ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^n$, for all $i = 1, \ldots, m$;

            2. (Compatibility with the program) if $c^T \alpha > c^T \beta$ and $\varphi(w^\alpha) = \varphi(w^\beta)$, then $w^\alpha > w^\beta$.

        Text
            {\bf Construction.}
            We outline here the construction of such an order, following Exercise 7 in [CLO, Chapter 8, Section 1].

            First, suppose that the vector $c$ defining the objective function contains only nonnegative entries.
            Define a weight order on the variables $w_1, \ldots, w_m$ by giving weight $c_j$ to $w_j$.
            We extend this to an adapted monomial order on $k[z_1, \ldots, z_n, w_1, \ldots, w_m]$ by treating each $z_i$ as lexicographically larger than every $w_j$.

            Assume now that $c$ is not nonnegative.
            For each $j = 1, \ldots, n$, define $d_j = \sum_{i=1}^m A_{i,j}$.
            (Note that $d_j > 0$ for otherwise the constraints in the linear program do not depend on $x_j$.)
            Equip $k[z_1, \ldots, z_m, w_1, \ldots, w_m]$ with nonstandard grading: $\deg(z_i) = 1$ for all $i$ and $\deg(w_j) = d_j$ for all $j$.
            Now for the term order, pick $\mu$ such that the vector $(c_1, \ldots, c_n) + \mu(d_1, \ldots, d_n)$ contains only nonnnegative entries.
            This gives rise to a weight order on $k[w_1, \ldots, w_n]$ which satisfies condition (2) above.
            We extend this to an adapted monomial order on $k[z_1, \ldots, z_n, w_1, \ldots, w_m]$ by again treating each $z_i$ as lexicographically larger than every $w_j$.

            Fix a matrix $A \in \mathbb Z^{m \times n}$ and integer linear program in @TO2 {toStandardForm, "standard form"}@ with constraints $Ax = b$.
            The following is a characterization of when the vector $x \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^n$ satisfies $Ax = b$, in which case we say that it is {\em feasible}.
            This condition is exactly [CLO, Chapter 8, Proposition 1.6].

        Text
            {\bf Proposition.} 
            Let $A \in \mathbb Z^{m \times n}$ and consider the feasible region $Ax = b$.
            Define a homomorphism of rings $\varphi:k[w_1, \ldots, w_n] \to k[z_1, \ldots, z_m]$, where $k$ is any @TO2 {Field, "field"}@, by 
            $$\varphi: w_j \mapsto \prod_{i=1}^m z_i^{A_{i, j}} \quad \text{for all } j = 1, \ldots, n.$$
            Then, a vector $x \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^n$ satisfies $Ax = b$ if and only if $\varphi(w^x) = z^b$.

        Example
            A = matrix{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
            b = matrix{{4}, {10}}
            isFeasiblePoint(A, b, {1, 1})

    Description
        Text
            Consider the integer linear program
            $$\text{minimize } c^T x \quad\text{subject to } Ax = b \text{ and } x \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^n,$$
            where $A$ is an $m \times n$ integer-valued matrix and $b \in \mathbb Z^m$, $c \in \mathbb Z^n$.
            Suppose that every entry in $A$ and $b$ is nonnegative.
            A solution to the problem is given by [CLO, Chapter 8, Theorem 1.11], which we now detail.

            We work in the polynomial ring $R = k[z_1, \ldots, z_m, w_1, \ldots, w_n]$, where $k$ is a @TO2 {Field, "field"}@, 
            equipped with an @TO2 {adaptedMonomialOrder, "monomial order adapted to the program"}@.
            For each $j = 1, \ldots, n$, let $f_j = \prod_{i=1}^m z_i^{A_{i,j}}$ and let $\mathcal G$ be a Gröbner basis for 
            $\langle f_1 - w_1 , \ldots, f_n - w_n \rangle$ in $R$.
            Consider the remainder on division $\overline f^{\mathcal G}$ of $f = z^b$.
            The result of [CLO, Chapter 8, Proposition 1.8] guarantees that $\overline f^{\mathcal G}$ is a monomial.
            Moreover, the program is feasible if $\overline f^{\mathcal G}$ involves only the variables $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ and, 
            in this case, a solution is given by the exponent vector of $\overline f^{\mathcal G}$.

            The following example is from [CLO, Chapter 8, Section 1].

        Example
            A = matrix{{4, 5, 1, 0}, {2, 3, 0, 1}}
            b = {37, 20}
            c = {-11, -15, 0, 0}
            solveILP(A, b, c)
        Text
            Alternately, one can write the program not in standard form, see @TO IsInStandardForm@.
            
        Text
            {\bf Remark.}
            Maximization and minimization (integer) linear programs are equivalent by multiplying objective functions by $-1$.
            This package treats every problem as a minimization problem and leaves the multiplication for maximiation problems to the user.

            The {\bf standard form} of an integer linear program is 
            $$\text{minimize } c^T x \quad\text{subject to } Ax = b \text{ and } x \in \mathbb Z_{\ge 0}^n.$$
            An integer linear program with constraints $Bx \le b$ is equivalent to one in standard form in the following way:
            One constraint $B_{j,1}x_1 + \cdots + B_{j,r}x_r \le d_j$ in this system is equivalent to the pair of constraints 
            $B_{j,1}x_1 + \cdots + B_{j, r}x_r + y_j = d_j$ and $y_j \ge 0$.

            Hence we rewrite the constrains $Bx \le b$ as $Ax = b$ by introducing {\em slack variables} $y_j$ and @TO2{"|", "concatenating"}@ a copy of the identity matrix
            {\tt A = B|I} of the appropriate size.
            (Note that we abuse notation here and write $x$ for both the vector of the given program and the vector that includes the slack variables $y_j$.)

            This equivalence does not change the objective function; we pad $c$ with a zero for each slack variable introduced.

        Example
            A = matrix{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}
            c = matrix{{5}, {6}}
            toStandardForm(A, c)

        specify whether the integer program is in standard form

    Description
        Text
            An optional method for @TO solveILP@ to specify whether a program is in @TO2 {toStandardForm, "standard form"}@.
            The default value is {\tt true}.
            If {\tt IsInStandardForm=>false}, we first convert @TO2 {toStandardForm, "to standard form"}@ before solving.

            The following example is in [CLO, Chapter 8, Section 1].
            Note that in contrast to @TO solveILP@ with {\tt IsInStandardForm=>true}, the output involves only variables that 
            are in the specified program, meaning that the slack variables, that get introduced to convert to standard form, 
            are omitted in the following output.

        Example
            A = matrix{{4, 5}, {2, 3}}
            b = matrix{{37}, {20}}
            c = matrix{{-11, -15}}
            solveILP(A, b, c, IsInStandardForm=>false)
