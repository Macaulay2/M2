   CotangentSchubert
  Headline
   A package for contangent Schubert calculus
  Description
   Text
    @BOLD "CotangentSchubert"@ is a package for calculations in cotangent Schubert calculus.
    Specifically, it allows to compute motivic Chern and Segre classes (as well as their limits in ordinary
    Schubert calculus, namely Schubert classes), and to independently compute the expansion of their products
    using puzzles. Puzzles and their "fugacities" are defined and computed using the results of [1,2,3].

   Set up cotangent Schubert calculus rings
  Usage
   (A,B,FF,I) = setupCotangent(dimensions,Presentation=>Borel)
   (D,FF,I) = setupCotangent(dimensions,Presentation=>EquivLoc)
  Inputs
   dimensions : Sequence
    of integers
   Presentation => Symbol
   Ktheory => Boolean
   Equivariant => Boolean
  Description
   Text
    This function sets up the various rings used by @BOLD "CotangentSchubert"@. Its behaviour depends
    on the value of the option @TT "Presentation"@.

    With @TT "Presentation => Borel"@, @TT "setupCotangent"@ returns a sequence made of two rings, a field and a list:
   Example
    (A,B,FF,I) = setupCotangent(1,3,Presentation=>Borel)
   Text
    The first (resp. second) ring is the cohomology or K-theory ring of the cotangent bundle of the flag variety specifided by the sequence of dimensions
    of flags (resp. of the corresponding full flag variety). The field is the base field (fraction field
    of the cohomology or K-theory ring of a point). The list is a list of labels for the various classes that
    @BOLD "CotangentSchubert"@ computes.
    The boolean option @TT "Ktheory"@ specifies the choice of K-theory or cohomology, whereas @TT "Equivariant"@ specifies
    whether the equivariance is w.r.t. scaling of the fiber of the cotangent bundle only, or w.r.t. scaling and Cartan
    torus action.

    With @TT "Presentation => EquivLoc"@:
   Example
    (D,FF,I) = setupCotangent(1,3,Presentation=>EquivLoc)
   Text
    the first output is a "diagonal algebra", i.e., a vector space over @TT "FF"@ with componentwise product. The last two outputs
    are the same as above.

  Inputs
   a : String
   b : String
   c : String
   Ktheory => Boolean
   Equivariant => Boolean
   Generic => Boolean
   Ktheory' => Boolean
    has an effect only if @TT "Generic => false"@
   Labels => Boolean
   Paths => Boolean
   Steps => ZZ
  Description
   Text
    This function produces a list of puzzles with boundaries given by strings @TT "a"@ (northwest side),
    @TT "b"@ (northeast side), @TT "c"@ (bottom side).
    The default @TT "Generic=>true"@ produces "generic" puzzles corresponding to the multiplication of
    motivic Segre classes @TO {sClass}@, whereas @TT "Generic=>false"@ produces "classic" puzzles
    corresponding to the multiplication of Schubert classes @TO {schubertClass}@ (in the latter case,
    @TT "Ktheory'=>true"@ produces puzzles for dual Schubert classes).

    The boundaries are encoded as strings of digits from "0" to "d", where d is the number of steps
    of the flag variety; alternatively, one can use lists of integers or strings (the latter allows for
    the possibility of having arbitrary puzzle labels on the boundary, such as "2(10)", even though
    this will not occur in normal puzzle computations). The special symbol "#" stands for any single digit,
    whereas "*" stands for any puzzle label.

    @TT "Labels"@ and @TT "Paths"@ are drawing options which only affect HTML and TeX output of puzzles.

   compute the fugacity of puzzles
  Usage
   fugacity P
   fugacityVector L
   fugacityTally L
  Inputs
   P : Puzzle
   L : List
    a list of puzzles
  Description
   Text
    To each puzzle is associated an element of the base field (cohomology/K-theory of a point), its so-called fugacity,
    in such a way that the sum of fugacities of puzzles with prescribed boundaries @TT"a"@, @TT"b"@, @TT"c"@, is equal
    to the coefficient of the expansion of the product of classes indexed by the strings @TT"a"@ and @TT"b"@ into the class
    class indexed by the string @TT"c"@. Here the classes are motivic Segre classes @TO{sClass}@ if @TT"Generic=>true"@,
    Schubert classes @TO{schubertClass}@ if @TT"Generic=>false"@.
    The options @TT "Ktheory"@, @TT "Equivariant"@, @TT "Generic"@ are inherited from the @TO{puzzle}@ by default,
    but they can be overridden.

    fugacityTally processes a list of puzzles, and returns a hash table where to each string appearing at the bottom
    of a puzzle is associated the sum of fugacities of the corresponding puzzles.

    fugacityVextor similarly processes a list of puzzles, and returns the result as a vector
    where each entry is the sum of fugacities of puzzles with a given bottom string.
    The ordering of strings is the same as the list returned by @TO{setupCotangent}@.
