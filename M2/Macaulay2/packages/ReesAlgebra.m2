    Compute Rees algebras and their invariants
  Description
    Text
     The Rees Algebra of an ideal is the
     commutative algebra analogue of the blow up in algebraic
     geometry. (In fact, the  ``Rees Algebra''
     is sometimes called the ``blowup algebra''.) 
     A great deal of modern
     commutative algebra is devoted to studying them.
     
     Classically the Rees algebra appeared as the bihomogeneous coordinate
     ring of the blowup of a projective variety along a subvariety or
     subscheme, used for resolution of singularities. 
     Though this is computationally slow on interesting examples,
     we illustrate with some elementary cases of resolution of plane curve
     singularities in @TO PlaneCurveSingularities@.

     The Rees algebra was 
     studied in the commutative algebra context (in the case where M is an ideal of a ring R), 
     by David Rees in
     a famous paper,
     
     {\em On a problem of Zariski}, Illinois J. Math. (1958) 145-149).
 
     In fact, 
     Rees mainly studied the ring 
     $R[It,t^{-1}]$, now also called the `extended Rees
     Algebra' of I. 

     The original goal of this package, first written around 2002,
     was to compute the Rees
     algebra of a module as it is defined in the paper {\em What is the
     Rees algebra of a module?}, by Craig Huneke, David Eisenbud and Bernd
     Ulrich, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 131, 701-708, 2002.
     It has since expanded to include routines
     for computing many of the invariants of an ideal or module
     defined in terms of Rees algebras.
     
     The Rees algebra, or more precisely the associated graded ring, which
     we compute as a biproduct, plays a central role in modern intersection
     theory: it is the basis of the Fulton-MacPherson definition of the
     intersection product in the Chow ring. We illustrate this in
     @TO distinguished@ and @TO intersectInP@.

     The Rees algebra of a module M is defined 
     by a certain ideal in the symmetric
     algebra $Sym(M)$ of $M$, or, as in this package, 
     by an ideal in the symmetric algebra of any
     free module $F$ that maps onto $M$. 
     When $\phi: M \to G$ is the {\em versal embedding}
     of $M$, then, by the definition of Huneke-Eisenbud-Ulrich,
     the {\em Rees ideal of M} is the kernel of $Sym(\phi)$. Thus the
     Rees Algebra of M is the image of $Sym(\phi)$.
     
     In most cases the kernel of the 
     $Sym(\phi)$ is the same for any embedding $\phi$ of
     $M$ into a free module:
     
     {\bf Theorem (Eisenbud-Huneke-Ulrich, Thms 0.2 and 1.4):} Let R be a Noetherian ring
     and let $M$ be a finitely generated R-module. Let $\phi: M \to G$
     be a versal map of $M$ to a free module. Assume that $\phi$ is an inclusion, and let
     $\psi: M \to G'$ be any inclusion. If $R$ is torsion-free over $\ZZ$
     or $R$ is unmixed and generically Gorenstein, or $M$ is free locally
     at each associated prime of $R$, or $G=R$, then the kernel of $Sym(\phi)$ and the
     kernel of $Sym(\psi)$ are equal.
          
     It follows that in the good cases above the Rees 
     ideal is equal to the saturation
     of the defining ideal of symmetric 
     algebra of $M$ with respect to any
     element f of the ground ring such 
     that $M[f^{-1}]$ is free, or is simply {\em of linear type},
     meaning that $Sym(\phi)$ is a monomorphism. This is the case,
     for example, when M is an ideal and $M[f^{-1}]$ is generated
     by a regular sequence.
     This fact often leads to 
     a faster computation than computing the
     kernel of $Sym(\phi)$ directly.
       
     Here is an example of the pathological case of
     inclusions $\phi: M \to G$ and $\psi: M \to G'$ where $ker(\phi) \neq ker(\psi)$.
     In the following, any finite characteristic would work as well.
    Example
     p = 5;
     R = ZZ/p[x,y,z]/(ideal(x^p,y^p)+(ideal(x,y,z))^(p+1));
     M = module ideal(z);
    Text
     It is easy to check that M \cong R^1/(x,y,z)^p.
     We write iota: M\to R^1 for the embedding as an ideal
     and psi for the embedding M \to R^2 sending z to (x,y).
    Example
     iota = map(R^1,M,matrix{{z}});
     psi = map(R^2,M,matrix{{x},{y}});
    Text
     Finally, a versal embedding is M \to R^3,
     sending z to (x,y,z):
    Example
     phi = versalEmbedding(M);
    Text
     We now compute the kernels of the three maps
     on symmetric algebras:
    Example
     Iiota = symmetricKernel iota;
     Ipsi = symmetricKernel psi;
     Iphi = symmetricKernel phi;
    Text 
     and check that the ones corresponding to phi and iota
     are equal, whereas the ones corresponding to psi and phi
     are not:
    Example
     Iiota == Iphi    
     Ipsi == Iphi
    Text
     In fact, they differ in degree p:
    Example
     numcols basis(p,Iphi) 
     numcols basis(p,Ipsi)

  Description
   Text
     Given a map between free modules $f: F \to G$ this function computes the
     kernel of the induced map of symmetric algebras, $Sym(f): Sym(F) \to
     Sym(G)$ as an ideal in $Sym(F)$.  When $f$ defines a versal embedding
     of $Im f$ then by the definition
     of Huneke-Eisenbud-Ulrich) this is equal to the defining ideal of the Rees
     algebra of the module Im f, the Rees ideal of M.
     
     When $M$ is an ideal (and in general in characteristic 0) then, by a 
     theorem of Eisenbud-Huneke-Ulrich, 
     any embedding of M into a free module may be used,
     and it follows that the Rees ideal is equal to the saturation
     of the defining ideal of symmetric algebra of M with respect to any
     element f of the ground ring such that M[f^{-1}] is free. And this
     often gives a faster computation.
     
     Most users will prefer to use one of the front 
     end commands @TO reesAlgebra@, @TO reesIdeal@ to compute the ideal.
   Example
     R = QQ[a..e]
     J = monomialCurveIdeal(R, {1,2,3})
     symmetricKernel (gens J)
   Text
     Let I be the ideal returned and let S be the ring it lives in 
    (also printed). The ring S/I is isomorphic to 
    the Rees algebra R[Jt].  We can get the same information
    above using {\tt reesIdeal(J)}, see @TO reesIdeal@. Note that the degree length
    of S is one more than the degree length of R; the old variables
    now have first degree 0, while the new variables have first degree 1.
   Example
     S = ring oo;
     (monoid S).Options.Degrees
   Text
     The function {\tt symmetricKernel} can also be computed over a quotient ring.
   Example
     R = QQ[x,y,z]/ideal(x*y^2-z^9)
     J = ideal(x,y,z)
     symmetricKernel(gens J)
   Text
     The many ways of working with this function allows the system 
     to compute both the classic Rees algebra of an ideal over a ring 
     (polynomial or quotient) and to compute the the Rees algebra of a 
     module or ideal using a versal embedding as described in the paper 
     of Eisenbud, Huneke and Ulrich.  It also allows different ways of 
     setting up the quotient ring.

  Outputs
    u:Matrix
      a matrix that induces a versal embedding of the R-module M
      into a free R-module.
  Description
   Text
      For any module M over a Noetherian ring R there is a map $u: M \to H$
      that is versal for maps from M to free modules; that is,
      such that any map from M to a free module factors through u. Such a map
      may be constructed by choosing a set of s generators for Hom(M,R), and using
      them as the components of a map $u: M \to H := R^s$.
      
      (NOTE: In the paper of  Eisenbud, Huneke and Ulrich
      cited below, the versal map is described with the 
      term ``universal'', which is misleading, since the induced map
      from H is generally not unique.)
      
      Suppose that $M$ has a free presentation $F \to G$, and let $u1$ be the
      map $u1: G\to H$ induced by composing $u$ with the surjection $p: G \to
      M$.  By definition, the Rees algebra of $M$ is the image of the induced
      map $Sym(u1): Sym(G)\to Sym(H)$, and thus can be computed with
      symmetricKernel(u1).  The map u is computed from the dual of the first
      syzygy map of the dual of the presentation of $M$.

      We first give a simple example looking at the syzygy matrix of the cube of
      the maximial ideal of a polynomial ring.
   Example
      S = ZZ/101[x,y,z];
      FF=res ((ideal vars S)^3);

      Here is an example from the paper "What is the Rees Algebra of a
      Module" by David Eisenbud, Craig Huneke and Bernd Ulrich,
      Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 131, 701-708, 2002.  The example shows that one
      cannot, in general, define the Rees algebra of a module by using *any*
      embedding of that module, even when the module is isomorphic to an ideal;
      this is the reason for using the map provided by the routine
      versalEmbedding. Note that the same paper shows that such problems do
      not arise when the ring is torsion-free as a ZZ-module, or when one takes
      the natural embedding of the ideal into the ring.
   Example
      p = 3;
      S = ZZ/p[x,y,z];
      R = S/((ideal(x^p,y^p))+(ideal(x,y,z))^(p+1))
      I = module ideal(z)
   Text
      As a module (or ideal), $Hom(I,R^1)$ is minimally generated by 3 elements,
      and thus a versal embedding of $I$ into a free module is into $R^3$.
   Example
      betti Hom(I,R^1)
      ui = versalEmbedding I
   Text
      it is injective:
   Example
      kernel ui
   Text
      It is easy to make two other embeddings of $I$ into free modules. One is
      the natural inclusion of $I$ into $R$ as an ideal:
   Example
      inci = map(R^1,I,matrix{{z}})
      kernel inci
   Text
      Another is the map defined by multiplication by x and y. 
   Example
      gi = map(R^2, I, matrix{{x},{y}})
      kernel gi
   Text
      We can compose $ui, inci$ and $gi$ with a surjection $R\to i$ to get maps
      $u:R^1 \to R^3, inc: R^1 \to R^1$ and $g:R^1 \to R^2$ having image $i$.
   Example
      u= map(R^3,R^{-1},ui)
      inc=map(R^1, R^{-1}, matrix{{z}})
      g=map(R^2, R^{-1}, matrix{{x},{y}})
   Text
      We now form the symmetric kernels of these maps and compare them.  Note
      that since symmetricKernel defines a new ring, we must bring them to the
      same ring to make the comparison.  First the map u, which would be used
      by reesIdeal:
   Example
      A=symmetricKernel u
   Text
      Next the inclusion:
   Example
      B1=symmetricKernel inc
      B=(map(ring A, ring B1)) B1
   Text
      Finallly, the map g1:
   Example
      C1 = symmetricKernel g
      C=(map(ring A, ring C1)) C1
   Text
      The following test yields ``true'', as implied by the theorem of
      Eisenbud, Huneke and Ulrich.
   Example
      A==B
   Text
      But the following yields ``false'', showing that one must take care
      in general, which inclusion one uses.
   Example
      A==C

  Description
    Text
      This routine gives the user a choice between two methods for finding the
      defining ideal of the Rees algebra of an ideal or module $M$ over a ring
      $R$: The command {\tt reesIdeal(M)}
      computes a versal embedding $g: M\to G$ and a surjection $f: F\to M$
      and returns the result of symmetricKernel(gf). 
      
      When M is an ideal (the usual case) or in characteristic 0, the same
      ideal can be computed by an alternate method that is often faster.
      If the
      user knows a non-zerodivisor $a\in{} R$ such that $M[a^{-1}$ is a free
      module (for example, when M is an ideal, any non-zerodivisor $a \in{} M$ 
      then it is often much faster to compute
        {\tt reesIdeal(M,a)}
      which computes the saturation of the defining ideal of the symmetric algebra
      of M with respect to a. This
      gives the correct answer even under the slightly weaker hypothesis that
      $M[a^{-1}]$ is {\em of linear type}. (See also @TO isLinearType@.)

      kk = ZZ/101;
      S=kk[x_0..x_4];

      {\bf Investigating plane curve singularities:} 
      
      Proj of the Rees algebra of I \subset{} R
      is the blowup of I in spec R. Thus the Rees algebra is a basic construction in
      resolution of singularities. Here we work out a simple case:
   Example
      R = ZZ/32003[x,y]
      I = ideal(x,y)
      cusp = ideal(x^2-y^3)
      RI = reesIdeal(I)
      S = ring RI
      totalTransform = substitute(cusp, S) + RI
      D = decompose totalTransform -- the components are the strict transform of the cuspidal curve and the exceptional curve 
      totalTransform = first flattenRing totalTransform
      L = primaryDecomposition totalTransform 
      apply(L, i -> (degree i)/(degree radical i))
   Text
      The total transform of the cusp contains the exceptional divisor with
      multiplicity two.  The strict transform of the cusp is a smooth curve but
      is tangent to the exceptional divisor
   Example
      use ring L_0
      singular = ideal(singularLocus(L_0));
      SL = saturate(singular, ideal(x,y));
      saturate(SL, ideal(w_0,w_1))
   Text
      This shows that the strict transform is smooth.

  Description
    Text
      The normal cone of an ideal $I\subset{} R$ is the ring $R/I \oplus{} I/I^2
      \oplus \ldots$, also called the associated graded ring of $R$ with
      respect to $I$.  If $S$ is the Rees algebra of $I$, then this ring is
      isomorphic to $S/IS$, which is how it is computed here.

  Description
   Text
     Given an ideal $I\subset{} R$, ``multiplicity I'' returns the degree of the
     normal cone of $I$.  When $R/I$ has finite length this is the sum of the
     Samuel multiplicities of $I$ at the various localizations of $R$. When $I$
     is generated by a complete intersection, this is the length of the ring
     $R/I$ but in general it is greater. For example,
   Example
     R=ZZ/101[x,y]
     I = ideal(x^3, x^2*y, y^3)
     multiplicity I
     degree I
  Caveat
     The normal cone is computed using the Rees algebra, thus may be slow.

     If M is an n x n+1 matrix in n variables, and all generators have the 
     same degree d, with ell = n as expected,
     then the special fiber is a rational hypersurface of degree $D := d^n$, and
     the reduction number is D-1.

     Special fiber is here defined to be the fiber of the blowup over the

     original ring is a tower ring, this might not be the fiber over the
     closed point! To get the closed

     Suppose that f:S\to R is a map of rings, and I is an ideal of S.
     Let K be the kernel of the map of associated graded rings
     gr_I(S) \to gr_(fI)R.

     The distinguished primes p_i in S/I are the intersections of the
     minimal primes P_i over K with S/I \subset{} gr_IS, that is,
     the minimal primes of the support in R/I of the normal cone of f(I).
     The multiplicity associated
     with p_i is by definition the the multiplicities of P_i in the primary
     decomposition of K.
     
     Distinguished subvarieties and their multiplicity
     (defined by the distinguished primes, usually
     in the global case of a quasi-projective variety and its sheaf of rings) 
     play a central role in the Fulton-MacPherson
     construction of refined intersection products. See William Fulton, Intersection Theory,
     Section 6.1 for the geometric context and the general case, and the explanation
     in the article Rees Algebras in JSAG (submitted).
     
     This application is illustrated in the code for @TO intersectInP@.
     
     We allow the special cases
     
     {\tt distinguished(I,J) := distinguished(f,I)}, with f:S\to S/J the projection
     
     and
     
     {\tt distinguished(I) := distinguished(f,I)}, with f:S\to S the identity.
          
     which computes the distinguished primes in the support of the normal cone gr_IS
     itself.

     ``A geometric effective Nullstellensatz,''
     Invent. Math. 137 (1999), no. 2, 427--448 by
     Ein and Lazarsfeld.
     
     Here is an example showing that associated primes need not be distinguished primes:
   Example
     R = ZZ/101[a,b]
     I = ideal(a^2, a*b)
     ass I

    Find a minimal reduction of an ideal
  Usage

  Inputs
    I:Ideal

    :Ideal
      A minimal reduction of I (defined below)
  Description
    Text
      {\tt minimalReduction} takes an ideal I that is homogeneous or inhomogeneous
      (in the latter case the ideal is to be regarded as an ideal in the 
      localization of the polynomial ring at the origin.). It returns an ideal $J$
      contained in $I$, with a minimal number of generators 
      such that $I$ is integrally dependent on $J$. This minimal number is called
      the analyticSpread of $I$.
     
      This routine is probabilistic: $J$ is computed as the ideal generated by the
      right number of random linear combinations of the generators of $I$. However, the
      routine checks rigorously that the output ideal is a reduction, and tries
      probabilistically again if it is not. If it cannot find a minimal reduction after
      a certain number of tries, it returns an error. The number of tries defaults
      to 20, but can be set with the optional argument @TO Tries@.

      To say that $I$ is integrally dependent on $J$ means that
      $JI^k = I^{k+1}$ for some non-negative integer $k$.  The smallest $k$ with this
      property is called the reduction number of $I$, and can be computed
      with @TO reductionNumber@ i.

      Note that this is inhomogeneous--
      it is generated by 3 random linear combinations

      There is no homogeneous ideal with just 3 generators
      on which i is integrally dependent.
    Example
      f = gens i
      for a from 0 to 3 do(jhom:=ideal (f*random(source f, S^{3-a:-2,a:-3})); print(i^6 == (i^5)*jhom))
  Caveat
     It is possible that the ideal returned is not a minimal reduction,
     due to the probabilistic nature of the routine.  This will be addressed in a future version

     the routine @TO minimalReduction@ occasionally, but rarely, returns an ideal
     which is not a minimal reduction.  In this case, the routine goes into an infinite loop.

   Description
    Text
     Let I be an ideal of R and let phi be the presentation matrix of I as a module.
     The symmetric algebra of I has the form 
     
     $Sym_R(I) = R[T_0..T_m]/ideal(T*phi)$
     
     where the T_i correspond to the generators of I. If $X = matrix\{\{x_1..x_n\}\}$,
     with x_i \in{} R, and ideal X contains the entries of the matrix phi, then there is 
     a matrix psi defined over R[T_0..T_m], called the Jacobian Dual of phi with respect to X,
     such that $T*phi = X*psi$. (the matrix psi is generally
     not unique; Macaulay2 computes it using Groebner division with remainder.)
     
     In the form {\tt psi = jacobianDual phi},
     a new ring ST := S[T_0..T_m] is created, and the vector X is set to the variables
     of R. The result is returned as a matrix over ST. 
     To do the computation in a ring previously defined computed, 
     use the form {\tt psi = jacobianDual(phi, X,T)};
     in this case, the matrices phi, X, T should all be defined over the
     same ring ST, 
     the matrix T should be a row of variables of ST, and
     the matrix phi should have entries in a subring not involving the entries of T.
      
     If I is an ideal of grade >=1 and ideal X contains a nonzerodivisor of R
     (which will be automatic if I has finite projective dimension) then
     ideal X has grade >= 1 on the Rees algebra. Since ideal(T*phi) is contained in the
     defining ideal of the Rees algebra, the vector X is annihilated by the matrix
     psi when regarded over the Rees algebra. If also the number of relations of I
     is >= the number of generators of I, this implies that the maximal minors of
     psi annihilate  the x_i as elements of the Rees algebra, and thus that the maximal
     minors of psi are inside the ideal of the Rees algebra. In very favorable circumstances,
     one may even have the equality reesIdeal I = ideal(T*phi)+ideal minors(psi): For example:
     
     Theorem (S. Morey and B. Ulrich, Rees Algebras of Ideals with Low Codimension, Proc. Am. Math.
     Soc. 124 (1996) 3653--3661):
     Let R be a local Gorenstein ring with infinite residue field, let I be a perfect ideal
     of grade 2 with n generators, and let phi be the presentation matrix of I. Let
     ell = ell(I) be the analytic spread. Suppose that
     I satisfies the condition G_{ell} or, equivalently, that the n-p sized minors of phi 
     have codimension >p for 1<= p < ell. The following conditions are equivalent:
     
     1) reesAlgebra I is Cohen-Macaulay and I_(n-ell)(phi) = I_1(phi)^{n-ell}
     2) reductionNumber I < ell and I_(n+1-ell)(phi) = I_1(phi)^{n+1-ell}
     3) reesIdeal I = symmetricAlgebraIdeal I + minors(n, jacobianDual phi)
     
     We start with the presentation matrix phi of an (n+1)-generator perfect ideal
     Such that the first row consists of the n
     variables of the ring, and the rest of whose rows are reasonably general (in this
     case random quadrics):
    Example
     setRandomSeed 0
     n=3;
     kk = ZZ/101;
     S = kk[a_0..a_(n-2)];
     phi' = map(S^(n),S^(n-1), (i,j) -> if i == 0 then a_j else random(2,S));

     apply(toList(1..ell-1), p-> {p+1, codim minors(n-p, phi)})
    Text
     We now check the three equivalent conditions of the Morey-Ulrich Theorem.
     Note that since ell = n-1 in this case, the second part of conditions
     1,2 is vacuously satisfied, and since r<ell,
     the conditions must all be satisfied.
     We first check that reesAlgebra I is Cohen-Macaulay:
    Example
     reesI = reesIdeal I;
     codim reesI
     betti res reesI
    Text
     Finally, we wish to see that reesIdeal I is generated by the ideal 
     of the symmetric algebra together with the jacobian dual:
    Example
     psi = jacobianDual phi
    Text
     We now compute the ideal J of the symmetric algebra; the call symmetricAlgebra I
     would return the ideal over a different ring, so we do it by hand:
    Example
     ST = ring psi
     T = vars ST
     J = ideal(T*promote(phi, ST))
     betti res J
     J1 = minors(ell, psi)
     betti (G = res trim (J+J1))
     betti res reesIdeal I
    Text
     The name Jacobian Dual comes from the case where phi is a matrix of linear forms
     the x_i are the variables of R, and the generators of I are forms, all of the same degree D;
     in this case Euler's formula sum(df_i/dx_j*xj) = Df can be used to express the
     entries of psi in terms of the derivatives of the entries of phi, at least when
     the degrees of the columns of phi are nonzero in the coefficient field.
     
     Explicitly, let x_1,...,x_n be the variables of R, and let phi be a presentation matrix for I.
     Since all the f_i have the same degree, if follows that,
     for each j, the entries phi_(i,j) will all have the same degree, say D_j = deg phi_(i,j).
     Let ST be the polynomial ring R[T_0..T_m], where the T_i correspond to f_i, and let
     X=matrix{{x_1,...,x_n}}, and T=matrix{{T_0,...,T_m}} be row matrices over ST.
     In this case, by Euler's formula, we may take
     
     psi_{k,j}=(1/D_j)*sum_i(d phi_{i,j}/d x_k*T_i),
   Caveat
     The division with
     remainder step is usually fast, but if this
     ever becomes a bottleneck it would be possible to test for the degree condition and
     use Euler's formula in the case where it applies.

     The Rees algebra S(M) of a submodule M of a free module (most importantly,
     an ideal in the ring), is equal to the symmetric algebra Sym_k(M) mod torsion.
     computing this torsion is the slow link in most of the programs in this
     package. The fastest way to compute it is usually by saturating the ideal
     defining the symmetric algebra with respect
     to an element in that ideal.

   Usage
    J = expectedReesIdeal M
   Inputs

    M:Module
   Outputs
    J:Ideal
   Description
    Text
     Let M be an R-module with g generators and free presentation phi: R^h \to R^g. The symmetric algebra of M
     can be written as R[T_1,\dots,T_g]/J, where J is the ideal generated by the entries of the 1 x h matrix
     T*m, where T = (T_1..T_g). If the entries of m are all contained in an ideal (X_1..X_n) (for example, when
     m is a minimal presentation and the X_i generate the maximal ideal, there is a matrix psi: R[Z]^h \to R[Z]^n
     such that T*phi = X*psi. Under reasonable hypotheses (eg when R is a domain) the relation
     X*psi = 0 in the Rees algebra implies that the n x n minors of psi are 0. Thus these minors lie in the ideal
     defining the Rees algebra. The expectedReesIdeal is the sum of the ideals (T*phi) and the ideal of nxn minors of psi.
     Under particularly good circumstances this sum is known to be equal to the ideal of the Rees algrebra. More generally,
     it may speed computations of @TO reesIdeal@ to start with this sum rather than with the ideal T*phi, as in the following
     example. (This can be turned off with the Jacobian=>false option.)
    
     The term 'Expected Rees Ideal' for the sum of 
     of the ideal of the symmetric algebra of I with
     the ideal of maximal minors of the Jacobian dual matrix of a presentation of I
     is derived from the paper 
     "Rees Algebras of Ideals of Low Codimension", Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 1996
     of Colley and Ulrich. Building on the paper 
     "Ideals with Expected Reduction Number", Am. J. Math 1996,
     they prove that this ideal is in fact equal to the 
     ideal of the Rees algebra of I when I is a codimension 2 perfect ideal whose
     Hilbert-Burch matrix has a special form. See @TO jacobianDual@ for an example.
    Example
     setRandomSeed 0
     n = 5
     S = ZZ/101[x_0..x_(n-2)];
     M1 = random(S^(n-1),S^{n-1:-2});
     M = M1||vars S
     I = minors(n-1, M);
     time rI = expectedReesIdeal I; -- n= 5 case takes < 1 sec.
     --time rrI = reesIdeal(I,I_0); -- n = 5 case ~20 sec
     --time rrrI = reesIdeal I; -- n = 4 case > 1 minute; I didn't wait to see!
     --assert(rI == (map(ring rI, ring rrI, vars ring rI)) rrI)
     kk = ZZ/101;
     S = kk[x,y,z];
     m = random(S^3, S^{4:-2});
     I = minors(3,m);

    Using the Rees Algebra to resolve plane curve singularities
   Description
    Text
     The Rees Algebra of an ideal I appeared classically as
     the bihomogeneous coordinate ring of the
     blow up of the ideal I, used in resolution of singularities. Though the general
     case is still out of reach, we illustrate with some simple examples of plane
     curve singularities. 
     
     First the cusp in the affine plane
    Example
     R = ZZ/32003[x,y]
     cusp = ideal(x^2-y^3)
     mm = radical ideal singularLocus cusp
    Text
     The cusp is singular at the maximal ideal (x,y), so we blow that up,
     and examine the ``total transform'', that is, the ideal generated by the 
     x^2-y^3 in the Rees algebra. 
    Example
     B = first flattenRing reesAlgebra(mm)
    Text
     Application of {\tt first flattenRing} serves to make B a quotient of the polynomial
     ring T in 4 variables; otherwise it would be a quotient of R[w_0,w_1], which
     Macaulay2 treats as a polynomial ring in 2 variables, and the calculation of
     the singular locus later on would be wrong.
    Example
     vars B
     proj = map(B,R,{x,y})
     totalTransform = proj cusp
     D = decompose totalTransform 
     D/codim
    Text
     We see that the reduced preimage consists of two codimension 1 components,
     the `exceptional divisor', which is the pullback of the point we blew up, (x,y),
     and the `strict transform'.
     The two components meet in a double point in the 2 dimensional variety
     B \subset{} A^2\times P^1. We have to saturate with respect to the irrelevant
     ideal to understand what's going on.
    Example
     irrelB = ideal(B_0,B_1)
     intersection = saturate(D_0+D_1, irrelB)
     codim intersection
     degree intersection
    Text
     We can see the multiplicities of these components by comparing their degrees to the
     degrees of the reduced components
    Example
     divisors = primaryDecomposition totalTransform
     strictTransform = divisors_0
     exeptional = divisors_1
     divisors/(i-> degree i/degree radical i)
    Text
     That is, the exceptional component occurs with multiplicity 2 (in general we'd 
     get the exceptional component with multiplicity equal to the multiplicity of the
     singular point we blew up.)
     
     We next investigate the singularity of the strict transform. We want to see
     it as a curve in P^1 x A^2, that is, as an ideal of  T = kk[w_0,w_1,x,y]
    Example
     T = ring ideal B
     irrelT  = ideal(w_0,w_1)
     sing = saturate(ideal singularLocus strictTransform, irrelT)
    Text
     We see that the singular locus of the strict transform is empty; that is, the curve is smooth.

     We could have made the computation in B as well:
    Example
     jacobianMatrix = diff(vars B, transpose gens strictTransform)
     codim strictTransform
     jacobianIdeal  = strictTransform+ minors(1,jacobianMatrix)
     sing1 = saturate(jacobianIdeal, irrelB)

    Text
     Next we look at the desingularization of a tacnode; it will take two blowups.
    Example
     R = ZZ/32003[x,y]
     tacnode = ideal(x^2-y^4)
     sing = ideal singularLocus tacnode
     mm = radical sing
     B1 = first flattenRing reesAlgebra mm
     proj1 = map(B1,R,{x,y})
     irrelB1 = ideal(w_0,w_1)
     totalTransform1 = proj1 tacnode
     netList (D1 = decompose totalTransform1)
     strictTransform1 = saturate(totalTransform1,proj1 mm )
    Text
     Here proj1 mm is the ideal of the exceptional divisor. 
     The strict transform is, by definition, obtained by saturating it away,
     The strict transform of the tacnode is not yet smooth: it consists of
     two smooth branches, meeting transversely at a point:
    Example
     strictTransform1 == intersect(D1_1,D1_2)
     degree (D1_1+D1_2)
    Text
     We compute the singular point of the strict transform:
    Example
     mm1 = sub(radical ideal singularLocus strictTransform1, B1)
    Text
     ...and blow up B1, getting a variety in P^2 x P^1 x A^2
    Example
     B2 = first flattenRing reesAlgebra(mm1, Variable => p)
     vars B2
     proj2 = map(B2,B1,{w_0,w_1,x,y})
     irrelB2 = ideal(p_0,p_1,p_2)
     irrelTot = (proj2 irrelB1) *irrelB2
     totalTransform2 = saturate(proj2 proj1 tacnode, irrelTot)
     exceptional2 = saturate(proj2 proj1 mm, irrelTot)
     netList(D2 = decompose totalTransform2)
     netList(E2 = decompose exceptional2)
     strictTransform2 = saturate(totalTransform2, exceptional2)
    Text 
     We compute the singular locus once again:
    Example
     time sing2 = ideal singularLocus strictTransform2;
     saturate(sing2, sub(irrelTot, ring sing2))
    Text
     The answer, {\tt ideal 1} shows that the second blowup desingularizes the tacnode.
    Text
     It is not necessary to repeatedly blow up closed points: there is always a 
     single ideal that can be blown up to desingularize 
     (Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry,Thm II.7.17).
     In this case, blowing-up (x,y^2) desingularizes the tacnode x^2-y^4 in a single step.
    Example
     R = ZZ/32003[x,y];
     tacnode = ideal(x^2-y^4);
     mm = ideal(x,y^2);
     B = first flattenRing reesAlgebra mm;
     irrelB = ideal(w_0,w_1);
     proj = map(B,R,{x,y});
     totalTransform = proj tacnode
     netList (D = decompose totalTransform)
     exceptional = proj mm
     strictTransform = saturate(totalTransform, exceptional);
     netList decompose strictTransform
     sing0 = sub(ideal singularLocus strictTransform, B);
     sing = saturate(sing0,irrelB)
    Text
     So this single blowup is already nonsingular.
