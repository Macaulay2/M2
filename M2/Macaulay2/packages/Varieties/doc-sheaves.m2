  Description
   Text
     Given a finitely presented graded module over a homogeneous ring $R$, one may always form a coherent
     sheaf on Proj$(R)$. This method formally constructs such an object in Macaulay2. The main difference
     between such sheaves in the affine versus projective case is that any truncation of a module will determine
     the same sheaf on Proj$(R)$. To obtain the simplest (from a readability perspective) use the @TO (prune, CoherentSheaf)@
     method.
   Text
     In the following example, we demonstrate the fact that Macaulay2 will consider different truncations
     of a module as representing the same sheaf.
   Example
     X = Proj (Q = QQ[x..z])
     F = sheaf ker vars Q
     isWellDefined F
     F' = sheaf truncate(3, module F)
     module F == module F'
     F == F'
     prune F'
   Text
     As demonstrated in the above, in order to reobtain the module representing the sheaf, use the @TO module@ command.
     Since such sheaves are determined only up to truncation, any module with finite length should determine
     the 0 sheaf:
   Example
     G = sheaf coker symmetricPower(4, vars Q)
     G == 0
   Text
     This method also works when the input is an ideal instead of a sheaf:
   Example
     m = ideal vars Q;
     H = sheaf m^4
     prune H --it "untruncates" the representing module
  Caveat
    Note that in Macaulay2, a coherent sheaf is completely determined by the data of its underlying module, and
    this data is stored rather primitively. It does not keep track of any kind of patching data on associated affine
    coverings since, computationally, such data is unnecessary.

    Text
      This method computes the canonical bundle of a projective variety $X$. Recall that the canonical
      bundle of a normal variety is the reflexive hull (aka the double dual) of the top exterior power of the cotangent sheaf $\Omega_X$ on a variety.
    Text
      An example --the example should be Serre duality and arithmetic genus computation
    Example
      Q = QQ[x_1..x_4];
      X = Proj Q
      omega = canonicalBundle X
      for i to 3 list HH^i (tangentSheaf X)(-1)
      for i to 3 list HH^i (dual( (tangentSheaf X)(-1)) ** omega)
      --I = ideal(x_2*x_3-x_1*x_4,x_3^3-x_2*x_4^2,x_1*x_3^2-x_2^2*x_4,x_2^3-x_1^2*x_3
      --ideal(x_3^2-x_2*x_4,x_2*x_3-x_1*x_4,x_2^2-x_1*x_3)
      Y = Proj(Q/(x_1^5+x_2^5+x_3^5+x_4^5))
      isSmooth Y
      omega' = canonicalBundle Y
      C = cotangentSheaf(2,Y)
      for i to 2 list HH^i (C)
      for i to 2 list HH^i ((dual C) ** omega') --dual
    Text
      We can use this to see the difference between the top exterior power of the cotangent bundle of Z and its reflexive hull.
    Example
      Z = Proj(Q/(x_1^2*x_2 - x_3^2*x_4))
      isSmooth Z
      for i to 2 list HH^i canonicalBundle Z
      for i to 2 list HH^i det cotangentSheaf Z
    Text
      Recall that the arithmetic genus is given by the number of global sections of the canonical bundle.
      Projective space has genus 0 in general, and smooth elliptic curves have genus 1. We verify the elliptic curve
      case in an example:
    Example
      R = QQ[x..z]/(y^3 - y*z^2 - x^3)
      E = Proj R
      for i to 1 list HH^i canonicalBundle E
  Caveat
      This method does not check that the input variety $X$ is normal, but rather always returns the reflexive hull of the top exterior power of the cotangent sheaf.

    :CoherentSheaf
      a sheaf represented by the depth 2-ification of the original representative module
  Description
    Text
      Given a sheaf $\mathcal F$ represented by some module $M$, there are always isomorphisms
      $$H^i (X , \mathcal{F}) = H^i_{\mathfrak{m}} (M)_0 \quad \text{for} \ i > 0,$$
      where $\mathfrak{m}$ denotes the irrelevant ideal. When $i = 0$ the best one can say in general
      is that there is an exact sequence
      $$0 \to H^0_{\mathfrak{m}} (M) \to \bigoplus_{d \geq 0} H^0 (X , \mathfrak{F}(d)) \to M \to H^1_{\mathfrak{m}} (M) \to 0.$$
      Thus, the prune command for a coherent sheaf computes a graded module $M'$ representing the same
      sheaf $\mathca{F}$, but such that there is an honest isomorphism
      $$M' \cong \bigoplus_{d \geq 0} H^0 (X , \mathcal{F} (d)).$$
      In other words, the prune command computes a module with depth at least 2 that represents the same sheaf $\mathcal{F}$.
    Example
      Q = QQ[x..z]; --KELLER: do example
    Text
      The pruning isomorphism of sheaves is cached with the key {\tt pruningMap}. It is an isomorphism of sheaves
      that is essentially never represented by an isomorphism of the underlying modules (at least in interesting cases).
    Example
      Q = QQ[x..z] -- DO example of accessing the pruning map
    Text
      Pruning also applies in a functorial way to morphisms of sheaves. 
    Text
      The method for computing the pruned representative proceeds with a few steps: first, the representative module
      $M$ is replaced by $M / H^0_{\mathfrak{m}} (M)$, which kills any torsion. Next, since $M$ is now torsion-free, we have
      an equality $\operatorname{Hom}_S (N , M) = 0$ for any module $N$ with finite length. Thus, we can choose
      a large formal Frobenius power $\mathfrak{m}^{[m]} = (x_1^m , \dots , x_n^m)$ of the maximal ideal so that $\operatorname{Hom}_S (\mathfrak{m}^{[m]} , M)$
      has depth at least $2$. Applying the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_S ( - , M)$ to the short exact sequence
      $$0 \to \mathfrak{m}^{[m]} \to S \to S / \mathfrak{m}^{[m]} \to 0$$
      yields a short exact sequence
      $$0 \to \operatorname{Hom}_S (\mathfrak{m}^{[m]} , M) \to M \to \operatorname{Ext}^1_S (S / \mathfrak{m}^{[m]} , M) \to 0.$$
      The induced map $\operatorname{Hom}_S (\mathfrak{m}^{[m]} , M) \to M$ is not an isomorphism of modules,
      but sheafifies to an isomorphism since the cokernel has finite length. This induced sheaf map is the pruning map,
      and the new representative is the sheaf associated to the module $\operatorname{Hom}_R (\mathfrak{m}^{[m]} , M)$.
    Text
      For morphisms, the above process can be made compatible with maps without much difficulty, since one only
      needs to conjugate the map by the pruning maps to get an induced map on the pruned representatives.
  Caveat
    Since the pruning operation for sheaves tends to be much more involved, one should be careful
    about the fact that pruning sheaves at every step of a computation may slow cause significant slowdowns.
