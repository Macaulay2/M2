    coherent sheaf cohomology module
  Usage
    HH^i(F(>=d))
  Inputs

    F(>=d):SumOfTwists -- see @TO2 {(symbol SPACE, CoherentSheaf, LowerBound), TT "F(>=d)"}@
  Outputs
    :Module
      over the homogeneous coordinate ring of the variety $X$
  Description
    Text
      Given a @syn CoherentSheaf@ @TT "F"@ on a @syn ProjectiveVariety@ $X$,
      the notation @TT "F(>=d)"@ creates an object representing
      the @syn SumOfTwists@ $\bigoplus_{a=d}^\infty\mathcal F(a)$.
    Text
      This command computes a graded module $M$ over the homogeneous coordinate ring of
      the variety $X$ such that the graded component $M_a$ for $a\geq d$
      is isomorphic to the cohomology group @TT "HH^i(F(a))"@.
    Text
      To discard the part of the module $M$ of degree less than $d$,
      truncate the module with @TO2 {"Truncations::truncate(ZZ,Module)", TT "truncate(d, M)"}@.
    Text
      Use @TT "HH^i(F(>d))"@ to compute the cohomology of the twists strictly greater than $d$
      and @TT "HH^i(F(*))"@ to try to compute the whole graded module.
      When $i=0$, this is known as the module of twisted global sections
      $$ \Gamma_*(\mathcal F) = \bigoplus_{a\in\mathbf Z}(X, \mathcal F(a)).$$
      Note that this computation will fail if the module is not finitely generated.
    Text
      As a first example we look at the cohomology of line bundles on the projective plane.
    Example
      X = Proj QQ[x_0..x_2]
      HH^0(OO_X^1(>=0))
      HH^1(OO_X^1(>=0))
      HH^2(OO_X^1(>=-3)) -- this should change to * once implemented
      TruncDual = HH^2(OO_X^1(>=-4))
      hilbertFunction(-4, TruncDual)
      hilbertFunction(-3, TruncDual)
    Text
      As a second example we compute the $H^1$ cohomology module $T$ of
      the Horrocks-Mumford bundle on the projective fourspace, which is
      an artinian module with Hilbert function (5,10,10,2):
    Example
      R = QQ[x_0..x_4];
      a = {1,0,0,0,0}
      b = {0,1,0,0,1}
      c = {0,0,1,1,0}
      M1 = matrix table(5,5, (i,j)-> x_((i+j)%5)*a_((i-j)%5))
      M2 = matrix table(5,5, (i,j)-> x_((i+j)%5)*b_((i-j)%5))
      M3 = matrix table(5,5, (i,j)-> x_((i+j)%5)*c_((i-j)%5))
      M = M1 | M2 | M3;
      betti (C=res coker M)
      N = transpose submatrix(C.dd_3,{10..28},{2..36});
      betti (D=res coker N)
      Pfour = Proj(R)
      HorrocksMumford = sheaf(coker D.dd_3);
      T = HH^1(HorrocksMumford(>=-1))
      apply(-1..2, i-> hilbertFunction(i,T))
  Caveat
    The computation of @TT "HH^0(F(*))"@ will fail if the module is not finitely generated.
    Also the version @TT "HH^i(F(*))"@ for $i>0$ is not yet implemented.

  Outputs

      the $i$-th cohomology group of @TT "F"@ as a vector space
      over the coefficient field of @TT "X"@
  Description
    Text
      The command computes the $i$-th cohomology group of @TT "F"@
      as a vector space over the coefficient field of @TT "X"@.
      For $i>0$ this is currently done via local duality, while
      for $i=0$ it is computed as a limit of @TO2 {(Hom, Module, Module), "Hom"}@s.
    Text
      See @TO "BGG::cohomologyTable"@ and @TO "TateOnProducts::cohomologyHashTable"@ for
      alternative sheaf cohomology algorithms via the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand correspondence.
    Text
      As examples we compute the Picard numbers, Hodge numbers and
      dimension of the infinitesimal deformation spaces of various
      quintic hypersurfaces in projective fourspace (or their Calabi-Yau small resolutions).
    Text
      We will make computations for quintics @TT "V"@ in the family given by
      $$ x_0^5+x_1^5+x_2^5+x_3^5+x_4^5-5\lambda x_0x_1x_2x_3x_4=0 $$
      for various values of $\lambda$. If $\lambda$ is general
      (that is, $\lambda$ not a 5-th root of unity, 0 or $\infty$),
      then the quintic @TT "V"@ is smooth, so is a Calabi-Yau threefold,
      and in that case the Hodge numbers are as follows.
      $$ h^{1,1}(V)=1,   h^{2,1}(V) = h^{1,2}(V) = 101, $$
      so the Picard group of @TT "V"@ has rank 1 (generated by the hyperplane section)
      and the moduli space of @TT "V"@ (which is unobstructed) has dimension 101:
    Example
      Quintic = Proj QQ[x_0..x_4]/ideal(x_0^5+x_1^5+x_2^5+x_3^5+x_4^5-101*x_0*x_1*x_2*x_3*x_4)
      singularLocus Quintic
      omegaQuintic = cotangentSheaf Quintic;
      h11 = rank HH^1(omegaQuintic)
      h12 = rank HH^2(omegaQuintic)
    Text
      By Hodge duality this is $h^{2,1}$.  Directly $h^{2,1}$ could be computed as:
    Example
      h21 = rank HH^1(cotangentSheaf(2, Quintic))
    Text
      The Hodge numbers of a (smooth) projective variety can also be computed
      directly using the @TO hh@ command:
    Example
      hh^(2,1)(Quintic)
      hh^(1,1)(Quintic)
    Text
      Using the Hodge number we compute the topological Euler characteristic of @TT "V"@:
    Example
      euler Quintic
    Text
      When $\lambda$ is a 5th root of unity the quintic @TT "V"@ is singular.
      It has 125 ordinary double points (nodes), namely the orbit of the point
      $(1:\lambda:\lambda:\lambda:\lambda)$ under a natural action of $\ZZ/5^3$.
      Then @TT "V"@ has a projective small resolution $W$ which is a Calabi-Yau threefold
      (since the action of $\ZZ/5^3$ is transitive on the sets of nodes of @TT "V"@,
      or for instance, just by blowing up one of the $(1,5)$ polarized abelian surfaces
      @TT "V"@ contains). Perhaps the most interesting such 3-fold is the one
      for the value $\lambda=1$, which is defined over $\QQ$ and is modular
      (see Schoen's work). To compute the Hodge numbers of the small resolution
      $W$ of @TT "V"@ we proceed as follows:
    Example
      SchoensQuintic = Proj QQ[x_0..x_4]/ideal(x_0^5+x_1^5+x_2^5+x_3^5+x_4^5-5*x_0*x_1*x_2*x_3*x_4)
      Z = singularLocus SchoensQuintic
      degree Z
      II'Z = sheaf module ideal Z
    Text
      The defect of $W$ (that is, $h^{1,1}(W)-1$) can be computed from the cohomology
      of the ideal sheaf of the singular locus $Z$ of @TT "V"@ twisted by 5 (see Werner's thesis):
    Example
      defect = rank HH^1(II'Z(5))
      h11 = defect + 1
    Text
      The number $h^{2,1}(W)$ (the dimension of the moduli space of $W$) can be computed (Clemens-Griffiths, Werner)
      as $\dim H^0({\mathbf I}_Z(5))/\mathrm{JacobianIdeal}(V)_5$.
    Example
      quinticsJac = numgens source basis(5, ideal Z)
      h21 = rank HH^0(II'Z(5)) - quinticsJac
    Text
      In other words W is rigid. It has the following topological Euler characteristic.
    Example
      chiW = euler Quintic + 2 * degree Z
