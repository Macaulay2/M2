-- Lemma. In: Proceedings 6th AAEEC, Lecture Notes in Computer Science
-- 357, Springer, 1989, 259--273.

-- initial comments: noetherNormalization takes an ideal I of a ring R
-- over a field k such that the dimension of I in R is d (fix these
-- symbols for all comments) and returns 1) a linear transformation
-- that puts the ideal in Noether position and 2) the independent
-- variables of R

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

integralSet = G -> (
     J := {};
     M := gens G;
     for i from 0 to numgens source M - 1 do ( -- check the gens of G to see if their leadMonomial is in a single variable
           if # support leadMonomial (M)_(0,i) === 1 then J = J | {support leadMonomial (M)_(0,i)} --checks how many vars are in the lead
           );
     J = unique flatten J; --note that according to the algorithm J is a set of integers (in fact indices), we choose to return the variables
     J);

-- comments: The procedure integralSet takes a Groebner basis G (ie a
-- list of polynomials) and returns the variables that already have an
-- integral relation. It does this by taking the lead monomial of each
-- polynomial and checking whether or not it consists of a power of a
-- single variable. We are assuming that the ring is over a field and
-- thus we don't check the lead coefficient.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

varPrep = (X,I) -> (
     U := support (independentSets(I,Limit => 1))_0;
     (U,X - set U)
     );
-- comments: varPrep is the initial function we run on the Groebner
-- basis of the inputted ideal I. It returns sets U and V, with U
-- being algebraically independent and V being algebraically
-- dependent. For all prime ideals it returns a maximal algebraically
-- independent set of variables whose cardinality is equal to d.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

lastCheck = (X,G,d) -> (
     M := gens G;
     i := 0;
     while i < numgens source M and not isSubset(support M_(0,i),toList(X_{0..d-1})) do ( 
	  i = i+1;
	  );
     if i != numgens source M then return false
     else(
     	  if X_{d..#X-1} != integralSet(G) then return false
	  );
     true
     );

-- comments: We use lastCheck to check that our final Groebner basis
-- (the gb of the ideal after the change of variables) witnesses the
-- integrality of each variable that should be integral. It first
-- checks that there are no elements of the Groebner basis with
-- support in the independent variables and then that each variable
-- that should be integral after the linear transformation is
-- integral.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

inverseSequence = (U,X) -> (
     N := {};
     for i to #X - 1 do (
	  for j to #U - 1 do (
	       if X_i == U_j then (
		    N = {X_j}|N;
		    break;
		    );
	       );
	  );
     return N;
     );

-- comments: inverseSequence is used to give the inverse of a ring
-- map. A ring map is given by a list explaining where each of the
-- ring's variables should go. If the ring map is just a permutation
-- of the variables then it is obviously an isomorphism and
-- inverseSequence returns the sequence that gives the inverse
-- morphism.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

randomSum = (U,V,k,rr) -> (
     for j to #V - 1 do (
	  if rr == 0 then 
	  U = apply(U, i -> i + random(k)*V_j) else 
	  U = apply(U, i -> i + random(-rr,rr)*V_j);
	  );
     return U;
     );


-- comments: randomSum is used to make the random linear
-- transformations which are candidates for putting I in
-- noetherPosition. It takes in two lists and adds the second to the
-- first with random coefficients.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- comments: noetherNormalization is the main method. An ideal I is
-- passed to it and its Groebner basis is immediately computed.  Next
-- a random linear transformation is applied and we check to see if
-- the ideal is in Noether position. We then check to see if the the
-- ideal in Noether position by partially computing a Groebner basis
-- for the ideal. If the partially computed Groebner basis witnesses
-- the integrality of all of the dependent variables, we are done, if
-- not we try again.  If the entire Groebner basis is computed and the
-- integrality is never witnessed then we apply another random linear
-- transformation and start the process again.
