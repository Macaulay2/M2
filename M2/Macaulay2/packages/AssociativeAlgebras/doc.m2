        Noncommutative algebra computations
    Description
        Text
            This code is in active development.  Currently 2-sided
            Groebner bases (up to some degree) are implemented, and
            most features of @TO "NCAlgebra"@ are available.  The package 
            {\tt NCAlgebra} uses curly braces to define non-commutative rings
            whereas this package uses angle bar lists.
        Text
            This package implements natively (i.e., in the Macaulay2
            engine) non-commutative rings (associative algebras),
            their (2-sided) Groebner bases, bases, and a number of
            other features.
        Example
            R = ZZ/32003<|a,b,c|>
            I = ideal(2*a*b + 3*b*a + 5*c^2,
                2*b*c + 3*c*b + 5*a^2,
                2*c*a + 3*a*c + 5*b^2)
            gbI = NCGB(I, 6);
            netList (ideal gbI)_*
            A = R/I -- only uses the Groebner basis already constructed, so only valid in degrees <= 6
            ncBasis(3, A)
    Caveat
        Not yet fully functional.  This package is a current work in
        progress.  The interface will change (even basic things like
        Groebner bases and the basis command still need to be hooked
        into the Macaulay2 groebnerBasis, basis commands), and more
        functionality is expected to be added.

      "Defining a noncommutative ring"
   Description
      Text
         A noncommutative ring is a @ TO Ring @ of subclass @ TO FreeAlgebra @ or @ TO FreeAlgebraQuotient @.
      Text
         In addition to defining a ring as a quotient of a @ TO FreeAlgebra @, some common ways to create
	 noncommutative rings include @ TO skewPolynomialRing @ and @ TO oreExtension @.      
      
         Let's consider a three dimensional Sklyanin algebra.  We first define the free algebra on the
	 variables x,y,z:
      Example
         A = QQ<|x,y,z|>
      Text
         Then input the defining relations, and put them in an ideal:
      Example
	 f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
     	 I = ideal{f,g,h}
      Text
         Next, we will define the quotient ring (as well as try a few functions on this new ring).
	 Note that when the quotient ring is defined, Macaulay2 computes the Groebner basis
	 of I (out to a certain degree, should the Groebner basis be infinite).
      Example
	 B=A/I
	 generators B
	 numgens B
	 isCommutative B
	 coefficientRing B
      Text
	 As we can see, $x$ is now an element of the quotient $B$.
      Example
         x
      Text
         If we define a new ring containing x, x is now part of that new ring.  For example,
	 we can use the following command to define the (-1)-skew polynomial ring on the
	 variables x,y,z,w:
      Example
      	 C = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x,y,z,w}) 
         x
      Text
         We can 'go back' to B using the command @ TO (use, Ring) @.
      Example
	 use B
	 x
	 use C
      Text
         We can also create an Ore extension.  First define a @ TO RingMap @ with @ TO map @.
      Example
	 sigma = map(C,C,{y,z,w,x})
      Text
         Then call the command @ TO oreExtension @.
      Example
	 D = oreExtension(C,sigma,a)
	 generators D
	 numgens D

   Outputs

   Description
      Text
         Let x be a homogeneous element in a noncommutative ring R. If x is normal then x determines
	 a graded ring automorphism f of R by x*a = f(x)*a.  This method returns this 
	 automorphism as a RingMap. 
      Example
         A = QQ<|a,b,c|>
	 I = ideal {a*b+b*a,a*c+c*a,b*c+c*b}
	 B = A/I
	 sigma = map(B,B,{b,c,a})
	 C = oreExtension(B,sigma,w)
      Text
         By construction, w is normal, and the normalizing automorphism is sigma
	 extended to C sending w to itself.  It follows that therefore w^2 is also
	 normal whose automorphism is the square of sigma extended to C in a similar
	 way.  We verify these facts with the following commands:
      Example
	 isNormal w^2        
	 phi = normalAutomorphism w^2
	 matrix phi
	 matrix (sigma * sigma)

   Description
      Text
         Let b_1,...,b_n be a monomial basis for a noncommutative Ring A in degree d. We assume A
	 is generated by elements a_1,...,a_k of degree 1. A homogeneous element r in A
	 is normal if a_i*r is in the span of the r*a_j for all i.
      Text
         Using the input symbols x and y, we define the "normal variety" to be the 
	 set of common solutions to the equations  
	 x_j*a_i*b_j = y_j1*b_j*a_1+...+y_jk*b_j*a_k 
	 for all i and j. Saturating the ideal at each x_i we extract polynomial equations
	 the x_i must satisfy for the element x_1*b_1+...+x_n*b_n to be normal in A.
      Text
         Before computing the normal variety, this method checks for normal monomials
	 in degree n. These are returned first to reduce the complexity of the problem.
	 Then the method computes the variety and returns its components. The equations
         the method returns are given in terms of the indexed variable x. The indices are
	 basis monomials in degree n.
      Text
         The following example is a 3-dimensional Sklyanin algebra.
      Example
	 B = threeDimSklyanin(QQ,{1,1,-1},{x,y,z})
	 ncBasis(2,B)
	 normalElements(B,2,r)
      Text
         The normal elements in degree 2 are x^2, y^2 and z^2. The basis
	 calculation shows y^2 and z^2 are normal forms in B. The normalElements
	 method first checks all basis monomials using @ TO isNormal @. In this case
	 it finds y^2 and z^2 are normal and returns this information. However,  
	 x^2 is not a normal form expression. The normal form of x^2 is y*z+z*y. In 
	 the second phase of the calculation, the method returns generators of the
	 ideal describing the normal elements (excluding the normal monomials). We
	 see the coefficients of basis monomials z*x and y*x must be 0 and the 
	 coefficients of y*z and z*y must be equal. These equations identify
	 x^2 = y*z+z*y as a normal element of degree 2.
      Example
         normalElements(B,3,t)
	 g = -y^3-z*y*x+y*z*x+z^3
	 isCentral g
      Text
         In degree 3, there are no normal monomials, so the first part of the return
	 value is the empty list.  The second coordinate of the return value is a single
	 matrix whose entries determine the equations that show that the only normal element
	 of degree 3 (up to scaling) is the central element g.

      "Basic operations on noncommutative algebras"
   Description
      Text 
         The AssociativeAlgebras package contains a number of methods for studying noncommutative
	 rings - primarily graded rings. The following three extended examples 
	 highlight the capabilities of the package.
      Text
         Our first example concerns a three-dimensional Sklyanin algebra. This example is
	 a PI-ring. We define the ring as a quotient of the tensor algebra on three
	 generators by the two-sided ideal generated by the three elements listed.
      Example
         A = QQ<|x,y,z|>
	 f = y*z + z*y - x^2
	 g = x*z + z*x - y^2
	 h = z^2 - x*y - y*x
	 B = A/ideal{f,g,h}
      Text
         It is known that this algebra has a unique (up to rescaling) central element 
	 of degree 3. We can verify this claim computationally using @ TO centralElements @
	 and check that the element is regular to a given degree. See @ TO isLeftRegular @.
      Example
         centralElements(B,3)
	 j = z^3+y*z*x-z*y*x-y^3
	 isCentral j
	 apply(5,i->isLeftRegular(j,i+1))
      Text
         In fact, we can see that j is (up to scaling) the only normal element of degree 3.
	 See the discussion above for interpreting the output of @ TO normalElements @.
      Example
         normalElements(B,3,n)
	 ncBasis(3,B)
      Text
         The user can create noncommutative rings in ways other than specifying a
	 presentation. For our second example, consider a skew polynomial ring on four
	 generators, where generators skew-commute (but are not nilpotent). See
	 @ TO skewPolynomialRing @ for more details.
      Example
         C = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x,y,z,w})
      Text
         Let us briefly note that the user can also define a skew polynomial ring 
	 with coefficients in a commutative ring.
      Example
         R = QQ[q]/ideal{q^4+q^3+q^2+q+1}
	 B = skewPolynomialRing(R,q,{x,y,z,w})
	 x*y == q*y*x         
      Text
         Returning to the main example, we can define a graded Ore extension of C 
	 by specifying an automorphism.
	 The function @ TO map @ is used to define a ring map. Note that ring maps 
	 are linear and multiplicative by definition but are not assumed to be  well-defined. 
      Example
         use C
         sigma = map(C,C,{y,z,w,x})
	   -- isWellDefined sigma
      Text
         We form the Ore extension of C by sigma. See @ TO oreExtension @.
      Example         
         D = oreExtension(C,sigma,a)
      Text
         The new generator a is normal and regular in D. Regularity (on the left or right)
	 can be checked one homogeneous degree at a time. See @ TO isLeftRegular @. 
	 Thus a determines a graded automorphism f:D->D via a*r=f(r)*a.
      Example
         isNormal a
	 apply(5,i-> isLeftRegular(a,i+1))
         sigmaD = normalAutomorphism a
      Text
	 Given an automorphism, one can check to see which elements it normalizes
	 in any given degree.
      Example       
         normalElements(sigmaD,1)
	 normalElements(sigmaD,2)
      Text
         One can check for the presence of normal elements more generally. In our
	 example, since a is normal, a^2 will also be normal. It is the only normal
	 monomial of degree 2. A complete description of the normal elements in a
	 given degree is given by @ TO normalElements @. 
      Example
         normalElements(D,2,P)
      Text
         Each component of the "normal variety" is a set of polynomial equations which must
	 be satisfied by the coefficients of the monomial basis for an element expressed
	 in that basis to be normal. In this case, the basis of D in degree 2 is
      Example
         ncBasis(2,D)	 
      Text
         The output of normalElements tells us that in order for a degree 2 element of D
	 to be normal, it must be an expression in powers of the generators, and that the
	 coefficients of these powers must satisfy the six nontrivial equations listed.
      Example
         isNormal (x^2+z^2-y^2-w^2)	 
      Text
         Of course, one has been able to define (graded) commutative algebras in Macaulay2 for
	 a long time.  Specifying graded commutativity is usually done with the
	 @ TO SkewCommutative @ option when creating the ring.  The user can convert such rings (and
	 their quotients) to a @ TO FreeAlgebraQuotient @ by using the command @ TO toFreeAlgebraQuotient @:
      Example
         E' = QQ[x,y,z,w,SkewCommutative=>true]
	 E = toFreeAlgebraQuotient E'
	 f = map(E,C,gens E)
	 use C
	 f x^2       
	 use E
	 x^2 == 0

	 If either list is not the appropriate length, then an error is thrown.  The generic 
	 such algebra has a fairly complicated Groebner basis, so the optional parameter
	 DegreeLimit may be provided to limit the maximum of a generator of a Groebner basis
	 found.  This value has been defaulted to 6.  If only one list is provided, it is used
	 for the variable names, and a random choice for each parameter (satisfying the nondegeneracy
	 condition given below) is chosen.
      
      	 In order to not get a degenerate example, one should ensure that the
	 parameters provided satisfy \alpha + \beta + \gamma + \alpha\beta\gamma = 0.
	 This method does not check this condition, since the degenerate examples are
	 of interest as well.  If no parameters are provided, however a generic choice
	 of \alpha,\beta and \gamma satisfying the equation above are selected.
      Example
         C = fourDimSklyanin(ZZ/32003,{a,b,c,d})
      Text
         In all nondegenerate cases, there is are two central elements of degree two which form
	 a regular sequence on the four dimensional Sklyanin (this was proven by Paul

     Compute the point scheme of the quadratic algebra B
   Usage
     I = pointScheme B
   Inputs
     B : FreeAlgebraQuotient
   Outputs
     I : Ideal
   Description
    Text
      This method computes the ideal defining the point scheme of the
      (assumed to be Artin-Schelter regular) algebra B.  This amounts
      to computing the ideal of maximal minors of the left quadratic
      matrix corresponding to the generators of the defining ideal of B.
      
      The point scheme parametrizes the point modules over the algebra B.
      A $B$-point module is a module $M$ that is generated in degree zero
      and whose Hilbert function is one for every nonnegative integer.
      In the commutative case, the point scheme of a graded ring $R$ generated
      in degree one is simply $\operatorname{Proj}(R)$, so this object serves
      as a way to introduce geometry in a noncommutative context.

      A straightforward calculation shows that a skew commutative polynomial
      ring in two variables still has point scheme given by $\mathbb{P}^1$,
      for example:
    Example
      S = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x_1,x_2})
      P = pointScheme(S,a)
    Text
      In higher variables, one gets smaller point schemes, however.  Indeed, the point scheme
      of the skew polynomial ring in four variables is a two-dimensional reducible scheme
      given by a union of six lines.
    Example
      S = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x_1..x_4})
      P = pointScheme(S,a)
      netList minimalPrimes P
    Text
      Three-dimensional Sklyanin algebras were shown by Artin-Tate-Van den Bergh
      to generically have point scheme given by a smooth elliptic curve, a defining
      equation of which we may obtain using this method.
    Example
      S = threeDimSklyanin (frac(QQ[a,b,c]),{a,b,c},{x,y,z}, DegreeLimit => 3)
      P = pointScheme(S,X)
    Text
      The genericity condition $(3abc)^3 \neq (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)^3$ is somewhat visible
      here.  Some non-generic Sklyanin algebras are still AS-regular:
    Example     
      S = threeDimSklyanin (QQ,{1,1,-2},{x,y,z})
      P = pointScheme(S,X)
      netList minimalPrimes P
    Text
      But as you can see, the point scheme is not a smooth elliptic curve.  In fact,
      if we add a cube root of unity to the base ring, we can see that it is a union of
      three lines (although M2 has trouble detecting this outright):
    Example
      R = QQ[zz,X_1,X_2,X_3]
      PP = sub(P,R) + ideal {zz^2 + zz + 1}
      minPP = minimalPrimes PP; netList minPP
      minPP / degree
    Text
      Indeed, this Sklyanin algebra is isomorphic to a skew polynomial algebra
      in three variables if the base field contains a cube root of unity.

   Description
     Text
       This method performs a two-sided Groebner basis calculation of the ideal
       $I$ to the degree $n$ given.  Possible strategies are "Naive", "F4" and "F4Parallel".
       If no integer is given, the Groebner basis is computed to twice the maximal degree
       of a generator.  As usual, one must take care not to provide too high of
       a degree here, as Groebner bases may be infinite in the noncommutative case.
       
       The current state of the algorithm requires the FreeAlgebra to be defined over
       a field, and the "F4" or "F4Parallel" strategies require the base ring to be
       a finite prime field $\Z/p$.

   Description
     Text
       This method computes the scheme that parametrizes the set of

       More precisely, it computes the image of this scheme under the Plücker
       embedding.
     
       As a first example, we see that the line scheme of the commutative
       polynomial ring is just the image of the Grassmannian Gr(4,2) in $\mathbb{P}^5$:
     Example
       S = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,1_QQ,{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4})
       L = lineSchemeFourDim(S,M);
       netList minimalPrimes L
     Text
       Next, we compute the line scheme of a (-1)-skew polynomial ring.
       We see that it is a union of four planes and three quadric surfaces.
     Example
       S = skewPolynomialRing(QQ,(-1)_QQ,{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4})
       L = lineSchemeFourDim(S,M);
       netList minimalPrimes L
     Text
       Finally, we consider the following AS-regular algebra of dimension four.
       Its line scheme is dimension one and degree 20, and is a union of
       10 conics.
     Example
       R = QQ <|x_4,x_1,x_2,x_3|>
