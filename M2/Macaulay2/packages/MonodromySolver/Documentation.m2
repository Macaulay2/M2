        solve polynomial systems via homotopy continuation and monodromy
    Description
        Text
	    This packages provides randomized methods for numerically solving polynomial systems of equations that occur in parametric families, by exploiting the transitive action of an associated monodromy group.
            The package implements the graph-based framework described in the third reference below.
	    There are three main functions that may be used to solve a system of a family of systems:
        Code
                UL {
		    TO solveFamily,
                    TO sparseMonodromySolve,
                    TO monodromySolve
		    } 
        Text
            @TO monodromySolve@ is the core function, whose input may be @ofClass PolySystem@ or $ofClass GateSystem$.
	    As an additional input, a seed pair consisting of initial parameter and solution values may be provided.
	    @TO solveFamily@ is a wrapper function that returns specific solutions and parameter values.
	    @TO sparseMonodromySolve@ is a blackbox solver for systems without parameters, that calls the core functio
	    These functions have many options in common, which are summarized in @TO MonodromySolverOptions@.
	    Here is an example illustrating how to solve a parametric family for specific parameter values.
        Example
            setRandomSeed 0;
            declareVariable \ {A,B,C,D,X,Y};
            F = gateSystem(matrix{{A,B,C,D}},matrix{{X,Y}},matrix{{A*(X-1)^2-B}, {C*(Y+2)^2+D}});
            p0 = point{{1,1,1,1}};
            sols = solveFamily(p0, F, NumberOfNodes=>3);
            for i from 0 to 3 list norm(evaluate(F, p0, sols#i))
        Text
            Each solver works by assembling randomly generated systems within a @TO HomotopyGraph@ and tracking paths between
            them. They are also equipped with a number of options, which may be useful for speeding up computation or 
            increasing the probability of success.
        Text
            In the example above, the system is linear in parameters, allowing for the seed pair to be computed automatically. 
	    The current seeding implementation will report failure in other cases.
	    Depending on the problem of interest, there may still be a natural way to generate the seed pair, as in @TO (monodromySolve, System, AbstractPoint, List) @.

    Inputs

            The output of @TO monodromySolve @ is opaque. This method is intended for users uninterested in the underlying

            For instance, the user can choose to have 4 vertices and 2 edges connecting
            each pair of vertices. Then the homotopy will run on the complete graph
            on 4 vertices, where each edge is doubled.

            This is an option for the Potential option for @TO "monodromySolve" @ when we use

            about the permutations generated by the underlying graph.) The expected value is computed by the ratio of unmatched
	    points and the difference between the total solution count and the number of the known points.
        Example
	    R = CC[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h][x,y,z];

    Description
        Text
            If the monodromy group is full symmetric and the degree is large, then the default settings have a good chance of generating the whole group. However, you will need to use a bigger graph than the default settings to fully generate imprimitive groups, as in the following example of a Euclidean distance degree calculation.
        Example
            setRandomSeed 100;
            declareVariable \ {t_1,t_2,u_0,u_1,u_2,u_3};
            paramMatrix = gateMatrix{{u_0,u_1,u_2,u_3}};
            varMatrix = gateMatrix{{t_1,t_2}};
            phi = transpose gateMatrix{{t_1^3, t_1^2*t_2, t_1*t_2^2, t_2^3}};
            loss = sum for i from 0 to 3 list (u_i - phi_(i,0))^2;
            dLoss = diff(varMatrix, gateMatrix{{loss}});
            G = gateSystem(paramMatrix,varMatrix,transpose dLoss);
            monodromyGroup(G,"msOptions" => {NumberOfEdges=>10})
    Caveat
        This is still somewhat experimental.
