    Description
        Text
            A digraph is a set of vertices connected by directed edges. Unlike the case with simple graphs, {u,v} being an edge does not imply that {v,u} is also an edge. Notably, this allows for non-symmetric adjacency matrices.
        Example
            G = digraph ({{1,2},{2,1},{3,1}}, EntryMode => "edges")
            G = digraph hashTable{1 => {2}, 3 => {4}, 5 => {6}}
            G = digraph ({{a,{b,c,d,e}}, {b,{d,e}}, {e,{a}}}, EntryMode => "neighbors")

    Description
        Text
            A graph consists of two sets, a vertex set and an edge set which is a subset of the collection of subsets of the vertex set. Edges in graphs are symmetric or two-way; if u and v are vertices then if {u,v} is an edge connecting them, {v,u} is also an edge (which is implicit in the definition, we will almost always just use one of the pairs). Graphs are defined uniquely from their Adjacency Matrices. These matrices use the entries as 0 or 1 to signal the existence of an edge connecting vertices.
            The options for EntryMode are "neighbors" and "edges" (the default).  This means that in including EntryMode => "edges" in the constructor allows the user to simply type in a list of edges to construct a graph.  See example 1 below.  Using the default takes an input of a list of pairs, where the first entry of each pair is a vertex and the second entry of each pair is that vertex's neighborhood.
            The options for Singletons allows the user to enter Singletons => {list of single points} in a graph if they desire to have isolated points in a graph.  See second example below.
        Example
            G = graph({{1,2},{2,3},{3,4}})
            G = graph({{1,2},{2,3},{3,4}}, Singletons => {5,6,7})
            G = graph ({{a,{b,c,d,e}}, {b,{d,e}}, {e,{a}}})
            G = graph hashTable {{1,{2}},{2,{1,3}},{3,{2,4}},{4,{3}}}
            G = graph(matrix {{0,1,1},{1,0,0},{1,0,0}})

This method returns a hash table where the keys are vertices of a given graph or digraph and the values are their children (or neighbors, in the case of undirected graphs).

    Description
        Text
            The adjacency matrix is the n by n matrix (where n is the number of vertices in graph/digraph G) with rows and columns indexed by the vertices of G. Entry A_(u,v) is 1 if and only if {u,v} is an edge of G and 0 otherwise. It is easy to observe that if we just use a simple graph G, then its adjacency matrix must be symmetric, but if we us a digraph, then it is not necesarrily symmetric.
        Example
            D = digraph({{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{4,3}},EntryMode=>"edges");

    Description
        Text
            The transpose of a digraph D is the graph formed by taking every edge (u,v) in D and changing it to (v,u). Intuitively, it reverses the direction of all the edges while keeping the same vertex set.  One can also view the transpose in terms of adjacency matrices, where the adjacency matrix of the transpose of D is the transpose of the adjacency matrix of D. In this way, we quickly see that the transpose of a transpose digraph is the original digraph, and that this operator is trivial for simple graphs since they have symmetric matrices.
        Example
            D = digraph ({{1,2},{2,3},{3,4},{4,1},{1,3},{4,2}},EntryMode=>"edges")

            a complete multipartite graph
    Description
        Text
            A complete multipartite graph is a graph that is first and foremost multi-partite. That is, the vertex set of a complete multipartite graph can be partitioned into k sets such that within each set, none of the vertices are connected by an edge.  The second condition is that each vertex is connected to ever vertex except for those in its partition so that it is "almost" a complete graph. For programming this graph, the input is a list P. The length of the list P will be the number of groups of vertices. For example, in a complete bipartite graph, the length of the list would be 2. The entry P_i will determine how many vertices are in each partition; necisarrily, we see that the entries of the list must be positive integers.

            G = completeMultipartiteGraph {1,2,3}

    Description
        Text
            The generalized Petersen Graph is a class of graphs with a particular edge set. There are two equal sets of vertices and each set is a cycle graph. This forms two disjoint cyclegraphs. Then each inside edge connects to an adjacent outside edge, similar to the circular ladder graph. The outer loop keeps a more "canonical" order for the cycle, in the sense that it does not "skip" vertices, while the inner cycle takes on a "star-like pattern" that jumps vertices but is still connected.

The isolated vertices are represented by 0's and the dominating vertices are rerpresented by 1's. In this method, the initial vertex is implicit and by default is constructed, so the first entry need not always be 0 in the list.

    Description
        Text
            The degreeCentrality of a vertex of a graph is the degree of a vertex divided by 2 times the number of edges of the graph.  Intuitively, this number will give a measure of how "central" a vertex is in a graph. In other words, if a vertex has a relatively high degreeCentrality, it is connected to more vertexSet than other vertexSet of G, so it is more central or a bottleneck in the graph. Note that the sum of the degree centralities must be 1.

            A depth first search begins at the first vertex of a graph as a root and searches as far as possible along one branch from that root before backtracking to the next branch to the right. Discovery time denotes the order in which the vertex was searched first; finishing time denotes the time in which the vertex's descendents were all finished.

            The descendants of a directed graph are all the vertexSet u of D such that u is reachable from v.
            Another way to more intuitively see what the descendants are is to see the descandants of a vertex v
            can be found by first taking the children of v. Then if you take the children of each of the
            children, and continue the process until the list stops growing, this will form all the descandants of v.

            The forefathers of a vertex v in a digraph D are all the vertexSet u in D such that v is reachable from u. Another way to more intuitively see what the forefathers are is to see the forefathers of a vertex v can be found by first taking the parents of v. Then if you find the parents of each of the parents of v, and continue the process until the list stops growing, this will form all the descandants of v.
        Example
            D = digraph({a,b,c,d,e},{{a,b},{b,c},{b,d},{e,b}});
            forefathers (D, d)
    Caveat
        The forefathers of a vertex in a digraph are more commonly known as the ancestors. But ancestors is an entirely different function in Macaulay 2, so forefathers is the convention we will use

    Description
        Text
            A graph is Eulerian if it has a path in the graph that visits each vertex exactly once.  A digraph is Eulerian if it has a directed path in the graph that visits each vertex exactly once.  Such a path is called an Eulerian circut.  Unconnected graphs can be Eulerian, but all vertices of degree greater than 0 of a graph (or all vertices of degree greater than 0 in the underlying graph of a digraph) must belong to a single connected component.
        Example
            bridges = graph ({{0,1},{0,2},{0,3},{1,3},{2,3}}, EntryMode => "edges");

The vertex set of the graph composition of G and H is the cartesian product of the vertex sets of G and H. The keys for each vertex will be output as a sequence to represent this.

            This method will add vertices (as singletons) to any already present graph. Note that if you add a vertex that is already in the vertex set of the input graph, that vertex will be ignored.
        Example
            G = completeGraph 4
            H = addVertices(G, {3,4,5})
            --Notice that since 3 is already a vertex of G, it is ignored

    Description
        Text
            A graph is bipartite if it has a chromatic number less than or equal to 2.  This method colors the graph two colors. In other words, it partitions the graph into two sets such that there is no edge connecting any vertex within each set.
        Example
            G = graph({{0,1},{1,2},{2,4},{3,4},{4,5}},EntryMode=>"edges");

            This method takes a graph or digraph and a list as the inputs. The List should be the vertices of the subgraph the user wants to consider, and the output will contain just those vertices and any edges from G that connect them.  This method also is a way of iterating deleteVertex several times in a quick way.

            This method reindexes the vertices of a specified graph or digraph according to the ordering method entered by the user.  The orderings available for graphs are:  "maxdegree" (orders the vertices in order of highest to lowest degree), "mindegree" (orders the vertices in order of lowest to highest degree), "random" (orders the vertices randomly), "components" (orders the vertices in the same connected components close together in indices), and "sort" (orders the vertices by sorting their names).  For digraphs, the orderings available are:  "maxdegreein" (orders the vertices in order of highest in-degree to lowest in-degree), "mindegreein" (orders the vertices in order of lowest in-degree to highest in-degree), "maxdegreeout" (orders the vertices in order of highest out-degree to lowest out-degree), "mindegreeout" (orders the vertices in order of lowest out-degree to highest out-degree), "maxdegree" (orders the vertices in order of highest to lowest degree in the underlying undirected graph), "mindegree" (orders the vertices in order of lowest to highest degree in the underlying undirected graph), "random" (orders the vertices randomly), "sort" (orders the vertices by sorting their names).
