    Data types and basic functions on graphs used in algebra and algebraic geometry. 
  Description
    Text
      This package is used to construct digraphs and graphs and
      perform basic functions on them. The user should note that this
      package assumes that all digraphs are acyclic.  Also, graphs are 
      assumed to have no loops or multiple edges. This package has
      functions to view graphs and digraphs.  These functions call the programs
      Graphviz and dot2tex and are only set up to function on Unix-like computers (e.g., Macintosh, Linux) at
      this time.

    graph
    (graph, HashTable)

  Headline
    The function that creates a graph.
  Usage
    graph(L)
  Inputs
    L:List 
      of edges of the graph or @ofClass HashTable@ with keys the nodes
      and values the neighbors of that node. 
  Outputs
    :Graph
  Description
    Text
      The graph is stored as a hash table whose keys are the nodes and
      whose values are the neighbors of the nodes.  The user inputs a
      graph by inputting a list of edges. There is an optional
      argument called Singletons to input nodes that have no neighbors. 
    Example
      A = graph({{x_1,x_3},{x_2,x_4},{x_1,x_4}})
      B = graph({{a,b},{c,d},{a,d},{b,c}}, Singletons => {f})
    Text  
      Alternatively, one can also create a graph by inputting a hash
      table whose keys are again the nodes of the graph and the values
      the neighbors of the nodes.

  Inputs
    L:List
      of pairs consisting of a node and its children or @ofClass
      HashTable @ with keys the nodes and values the children of that
      node.  
  Outputs
    :Digraph
  Description
    Text
      The digraph is stored as a hash table whose keys are the names
      of the nodes and whose values are the children of those nodes.
      The user inputs a digraph by inputting a list of pairs whose first
      element is a node and whose second element is the list of children
      of that node.  If a node has no children, it should still be
      included in the list of pairs followed by an empty list.
      Alternatively, one could also input a hash table where the keys are
      the nodes and the values the set of children.
    Example
      D = digraph({{a, {b,c}}, {b,{d,e}}, {c, {e,h}}, {d, {f}}, {e, {f,g}},
  	  {f, {}}, {g, {}}, {h, {}}})

  Description
    Text
      A mixed graph is stored as a HashTable whose keys are the types
      Graph, Digraph, and Bigraph.  The values are the corresponding
      graphs.   The order of the input matters.  An error is issued if
      the first argument is not a graph, the second a Digraph and the
      third a Bigraph.  
   Example
      D = digraph({{a, {b,c}}, {b,{d,e}}, {c, {e,h}}, {d, {f}}, {e, {f,g}},
  	  {f, {}}, {g, {}}, {h, {}}})
