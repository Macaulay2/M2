     Headline
     	  Interface for 4ti2
     Description
          Text
	       Interfaces most of the functionality of the software {\tt 4ti2} available at
	       @HREF"http://www.4ti2.de/"@.
	       (The user needs to have {\tt 4ti2} installed on his/her machine.)
	        
	       A $d\times n$ integral matrix $A$ (with nonnegative entries) specifies a map from a polynomial 
	       ring in d variables to a polynomial ring with n variables by specifying exponents of the variables indexing
	       its columns. For example, if $A$ is a matrix 
	       $$\begin{pmatrix}
	       3&2&1&0\\
	       0&1&2&3
	       \end{pmatrix}$$
	       the map from $k[s,t]$ to $k[a,b,c,d]$ is given by
	       $(s,t) \mapsto \ (s^3,s^2t,st^2,t^3)$.
	       
	       The toric ideal $I_A$ is the kernel of this map. 
	       It is minimally generated by the 2-minors of the matrix
	       $$\begin{pmatrix}
	       x&y&z\\
	       y&z&w
	       \end{pmatrix}$$
	       Given the matrix $A$, one can compute its lattice basis ideal specified by the integral basis
	       of the lattice $A$, the toric ideal $I_A$, its Groebner bases, etc. In practice, however, 
	       these are nontrivial computational tasks. 
	       The software {\tt 4ti2} is very efficient in computing these objects. 	      
	       
	       For more theoretical details (and more generality), see the standard reference: 
	       B. Sturmfels, {\bf Gr\"obner bases and convex polytopes.} 
	       American Mathematical Society, University Lectures Series, No 8, Providence, Rhode Island, 1996. 
	       
               {\bf Note for cygwin users:} 
	       If a problem occurs during package installation and/or loading, it should be fixed 
	       by setting the path inside the file {\tt .Macaulay2/init-FourTiTwo.m2}  to whatever folder {\tt 4ti2} is installed.
	       For example, if  {\tt 4ti2} has been installed in {\tt C:/cygwin/4ti2/win32}, then the line 
	       inside the {\tt init-FourTiTwo.m2} file will look like this:  {\tt "path" => "C:/cygwin/4ti2/win32/"}  .
	       Alternately, the path for {\tt 4ti2} may be set when loading the package using the following command:
	         loadPackage("FourTiTwo", Configuration=>{"path"=>"C:/cygwin/4ti2/win32/"})
	       assuming that 4ti2 has been installed in C:/cygwin/4ti2/win32.
      	       
     Caveat
      	       If the package SimpleDoc is not found when installing {\tt FourTiTwo.m2}, 
	       see questions and answers 6, 7, and 8 on the Macaulay 2 web site.

	  Example
	       A = matrix"1,1,1,1;0,1,2,3"
	  Text
	       Since there are 4 columns, the ideal will live in the polynomial ring with 4 variables.
	  Example
	       R = QQ[a..d]
	       M = toricMarkov(A)
	  Text
	       Note that rows of M are the exponents of minimal generators of $I_A$.  To get the ideal, we can do the following:
	  Example
      	       I = toBinomial(M,R)
	  Text
	       Alternately, we might wish to give a lattice basis ideal instead of the matrix A. The lattice basis will be specified

	       We can see that the two ideals are equal:

     Description
     	  Text
	       Very often the Graver basis consits of too many binomials, and one is only interested in their degrees. In this case,
	       instead of looking at the Graver basis of $I_A$, we may just want to look for the degrees of binomials which show up:
	  Example
	       A = matrix "1,1,1,1; 1,2,3,4"
	       toricGraver(A) -- the Graver basis
	       toricGraverDegrees(A) -- just the degrees
	  Text
	       Note that these are all 1-norms of the vectors. Since $I_A$ is homogeneous, there are 3 binomials of degree 2 (norm 4) 
	       and 2 binomials of degree 3 (norm 6).
	       
	       Here is a more complicated example, where one may not want to see the Graver basis elements explicitly. 
	       The toric ideal I_M is the ideal of the rational normal scroll S(3,2,3):
	  Example
	       M = matrix "1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1; 1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0; 0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0; 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1; 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,1,2,3,4"
	       toricGraverDegrees(M)
	  Text
	       Here is another example where with many Graver basis elements. The following matrix is a design matrix for a particular statistical model for a 4-node p1 network; see Fienberg-Petrovic-Rinaldo.

     Usage
     	  toricCircuits(A)
     Inputs
      	  A:Matrix    
               whose columns parametrize the toric variety. The toric ideal $I_A$ is the kernel of the map defined by {\tt A}

	       whose rows form the circuits of A
     Description
     	  Text
	       The circuits are contained in the Graver basis of $I_A$. In fact, they are precisely the primitive binomials in the ideal
	       with  minimal support.
	  Example
	       A = matrix "1,1,1,1; 1,2,3,4"
	       C = toricCircuits A
	  Text 
	       The ideal generated by the circuits of A in general differs from the toric ideal of A. For example:
	  Example
	       R = QQ[a..d]
	       Icircuit = toBinomial(toricCircuits(A), R) -- this is the circuit ideal of A
	       I = toBinomial(toricMarkov(A), R)
	       I==Icircuit  
	  Text
	       The two ideals are not the same. There is a minimal generator of I which is not a circuit:
	  Example
	       a*d-b*c % I -- this binomial is in I:
	       a*d-b*c % Icircuit -- but not in Icircuit:

-- Notes from Mike talking with Peter Malkin, 4/21/09

in 1.3.2 (and in 1.3.1):

These routines use the structure below:

groebner, markov, 
hilbert, graver, zsolve
rays, circuits, qsolve

also: minimise, walk, normalform

a.mat: m by n
a.rel: 1 by m: symols: >, =, <  (means: >= 0, == 0, <= 0)
a.sign: 1 by n matrix: 0,1,-1,2

a.sign: 0:  x_i unrestricted in sign
        1:  x_i >= 0
	-1: x_i <= 0.
	2:  x_i is a Graver component

a.mat, a.rel, a.sign.

groebner, markov, zsolve: also can give a.rhs (1 x n matrix).

groebner does this:
Ax >= 0, x>=0.

Ax-Iy = 0, x >= 0, y >= 0.

doc on main page of 4ti2 web site: manual, and the slides.
.rhs doesn't work for qsolve though, possibly.

for hilbert, graver, zsolve, have the following filter:
.ub, .lb can be used to provide upper and lower bounds (lower only for Graver components, or for <= vars).

install glpk first, and make sure gmp is visible.
./configure --with-gmp=.... --with-glpk=....

call the different routines as: -p32, -p64, -parb

tests are in 
4ti2-1.3.2/test

email Peter if I have more questions
