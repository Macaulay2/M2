    VirtualResolutions

    a package for computing virtual resolutions
  Description
    Text
     While graded minimal free resolutions are useful for studying quasicoherent
     sheaves over projective space, when working over a product of projective spaces or, more generally,
     over smooth projective toric varieties, graded minimal free resolutions over the Cox ring
     seem too restricted by algebraic structure that is in some sense unimportant geometrically. By allowing
     a limited amount of homology, virtual resolutions offer a more flexible alternative for
     studying toric subvarieties when compared to minimal graded free resolutions.

     Introduced by Berkesch, Erman, and Smith in {\em Virtual resolutions for a product of projective spaces}
     (see [BES20, @arXiv "1703.07631"@]) if $X$ is a smooth toric variety, $S$ is the Cox ring of $X$
     graded by the Picard group of $X$, and $B\subset S$ is the irrelevant ideal of $X$, then
     a virtual resolution of a graded $S$-module $M$ is a complex of graded free $S$-modules, which
     sheafifies to a resolution of the associated sheaf of $M$.

     This package provides tools for constructing and studying virtual resolutions for products of projective spaces.
     In particular, it implements a number of the methods for constructing virtual resolutions for products of projective
     spaces as introduced by Berkesch, Erman, and Smith. This package also contains methods for constructing curves in
     $\PP^1\times\PP^2$, as these are a natural source for interesting virtual resolutions.

     As a running example, consider three points $([1:1],[1:4])$, $([1:2],[1:5])$, and $([1:3],[1:6])$
     in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$.

    Example
     X = toricProjectiveSpace(1)**toricProjectiveSpace(1);
     S = ring X;
     B = ideal X;
     J = saturate(intersect(
         ideal(x_1 - x_0, x_3 - 4*x_2),
         ideal(x_1 - 2*x_0, x_3 - 5*x_2),
         ideal(x_1 - 3*x_0, x_3 - 6*x_2)), B);
     minres = res J;
     multigraded betti minres
    Text
     As described in Algorithm 3.4 of Berkesch, Erman, and Smith's
     paper, one may construct a virtual resolution of a module from its graded minimal free resolution and
     an element of the multigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the module. (See Maclagan and Smith's paper
     {\em Multigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford Regularity} (see [MS04, @arXiv "math/0305214"@]) for the definition of multigraded regularity.)
     Building on the @TO TateOnProducts@ package, this package contains a function allowing one
     to compute the minimal elements of the multigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a $B$-saturated module.

     Continuing the example from above, we see that $(2,0)$ is an element of the multigraded
     regularity of $S/J$. From this we can compute a virtual resolution of $S/J$.
    Example
     multigradedRegularity(X, J)
     vres = virtualOfPair(J, {{3,1}})
     multigraded betti vres
    Text
     Notice that this virtual resolution of $S/J$ is much shorter and thinner than the graded minimal
     free resolution of $S/J$. This is a common theme: virtual resolutions tend to be much
     shorter and less wide than graded minimal free resolutions over the Cox ring, but they still
     preserve geometric information about $S/J$.

     In addition to the functions highlighted above, the @TT "VirtualResolutions"@ package contains
     a number of other tools for constructing and studying virtual resolutions. In particular,
     there are functions to construct virtual resolutions for zero dimensionsal subschemes, to
     check whether a complex is a virtual resolution, and to construct curves in $\PP^1\times\PP^2$.

            Given the irrelevant ideal irr of a NormalToricVariety and a chain complex C, isVirtual returns true if
            {\tt C}is a virtual resolution of some module. If not, it returns false. This is done by checking that the
	    higher homology groups of {\tt C}are supported on the irrelevant ideal.

            If debugLevel is larger than zero, the homological degree where isVirtual fails is printed.

          in $\PP^1 \times \PP^1$, we can check whether the virtual complex we compute below and
          in other places is in fact virtual.
        Example
          Y = toricProjectiveSpace(1)**toricProjectiveSpace(1);
          S = ring Y;
          B = ideal Y;

            Given an ideal {\tt J} defining a curve $C$ in $\PP^3$, @TT "curveFromP3toP1P2"@ produces the ideal of the curve
            in $\PP^1\times\PP^2$ defined as follows:
            consider the projections $\PP^3\to\PP^2$ and $\PP^3\to\PP^1$ from the point [0:0:0:1]
            and the line [0:0:s:t], respectively. The product of these defines a map from $\PP^3$ to $\PP^1\times\PP^2$.
            The curve produced by @TT "curveFromP3toP1P2"@ is the image of the input curve under this map.

            This computation is done by first constructing the graph in $\PP^3\times(\PP^1\times\PP^2)$ of the product
            of the two projections $\PP^3\to\PP^2$ and $\PP^3\to\PP^1$ defined above.
            This graph is then intersected with $C\times(\PP^1\times\PP^2)$. A curve in $\PP^1\times\PP^2$ is then
            obtained from this by saturating and then eliminating.

            Note the curve in $\PP^1\times\PP^2$ will have degree and genus equal to the degree and genus of $C$ as long as $C$
            does not intersect the base locus of the projection. If the option @TO [curveFromP3toP1P2, PreserveDegree]@
	    is set to true, @TT "curveFromP3toP1P2"@ will check whether $C$ intersects the base locus.
	    If it does, the function will return an error. If PreserveDegree is set to false, this check is not
            performed and the output curve in $\PP^1\times\PP^2$ may have degree and genus different from $C$.

    Description
        Text
          Given an ideal I or module M and a list of multidegrees L, this function produces a chain complex by iteratively
          computing syzygies in degrees in L. In particular, if the list L contains only one element which is in the
          multigraded regularity of M plus the dimension vector, the output will be the virtual resolution of a pair as
          defined in Section 1 of [BES20]. See Algorithm 3.4 of [BES20, @arXiv "1703.07631"@] for further details.

          If a resolution for the object exists in the cache or when the input is a chain complex C, virtualOfPair uses
          this information by simply removing the summands in degrees not in L. This option is useful when a minimal free
          resolution of M can be more efficiently computed in the engine or is already known. Otherwise, induced Schreyer
          orders are used to speed up the computation of syzygies. Note that this speedup is often very significant.

          When L contains more than one multidegree, summands with degrees in at least one member of L are kept.

          For example, consider the ideal of three points in $\PP^1\times\PP^1$.
        Example
          X = toricProjectiveSpace(1) ** toricProjectiveSpace(1);
          S = ring X; B = ideal X;
          J = saturate(intersect(
                ideal(x_1 - 1*x_0, x_3 - 4*x_2),
                ideal(x_1 - 2*x_0, x_3 - 5*x_2),
                ideal(x_1 - 3*x_0, x_3 - 6*x_2)),
                B)
        Text
          We can now compute its minimal free resolution and a virtual resolution. One can show that $(2,0)$ is in the multigraded
          regularity of this example. Thus, since we want to compute a virtual resolution we apply virtualOfPair to the element
          $(3,1)$ since $(3,1)=(2,0)+(1,1)$ and $(1,1)$ is the dimension vector for $\PP^1\times\PP^1$.
        Example
          minres = res J
          vres = virtualOfPair(J, {{3,1}}) --(3,1) = (2,0) + (1,1)
        Text
          Notice that the virtual resolution of the pair $(S^1/J, (2,0))$ is shorter and thinner than the graded minimal free
          resolution of $S^1/J$.

          Finally, we check that the result is indeed virtual.
        Example
          isVirtual(B, vres)
    Caveat
        Given an element of the multigraded regularity, one must add the dimension vector of the product of projective spaces
        for this to return a virtual resolution.

    Description
        Text
          Given a module M over a multigraded ring S or a product of toric varieties X, this method finds the
          minimal elements of the multigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of M as defined in Definition 1.1
          of [MS04] (see @arXiv "math/0305214"@). If the input is an ideal, multigraded regularity of $S^1/I$ is computed.

          This is done by calling the @TO cohomologyHashTable@ method from @TO TateOnProducts@ and checking for the
          multidegrees where Hilbert polynomial and Hilbert function match and where the higher sheaf cohomology
          vanishes.

          Note that the module or ideal is assumed to be saturated by the irrelevant ideal of the Cox ring.

          As an example, here we compute the minimal elements of the multigraded regularity for Example 1.4
          of [BES20] (see @arXiv "1703.07631"@). We consider the example of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 4 in $\PP^1\times\PP^2$.
        Example
          X = toricProjectiveSpace(1)**toricProjectiveSpace(2)
          S = ring X; B = ideal X;
          I = ideal(x_0^2*x_2^2+x_1^2*x_3^2+x_0*x_1*x_4^2, x_0^3*x_4+x_1^3*(x_2+x_3))
        Text
          After saturating the defining ideal by the irrelevant ideal we may compute its multigraded regularity.
        Example
          J = saturate(I,B);
          debugLevel = 1
          L = multigradedRegularity(X, J)
        Text
          This method also accepts the ring provided by @TO productOfProjectiveSpaces@ from the @TO TateOnProducts@ package.
    Caveat
        The input is assumed to be saturated.
        Moreover, if the input is a module generated in non-positive degrees, then the output may be incorrect.
        In that case, adding the optional argument

        @PRE "LowerLimit => apply(n, i -> min(degrees M / (deg -> deg_i))) - dim X"@

        where {\tt M} is the module and {\tt X} is the toric variety, may be a sufficient solution.
