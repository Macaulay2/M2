    differential annihilator of a polynomial in a Weyl algebra
  Usage
    AnnFs(f)
  Inputs
    f:RingElement
      polynomial in a Weyl algebra $D$

     :Ideal

  Description
    Text
     This routine computes the ideal of the differential annihilator of a polynomial. This ideal is a left ideal of the ring $D[s]$.  More
     details can be found in 
     [@HREF("https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/1734566.pdf","SST")@, Chapter 5].  
     The computation in the case of the element $f$ is via  Algorithm 5.3.6.
    Example
      makeWA(QQ[x,y])
      f = x^2+y
      AnnFs f
  Caveat
     Must be over a ring of characteristic $0$.

       the result of applying the product of the $(dx_i)^{m_i}$ to $g/f^a$, written as

  Description
    Text
     Let $D$ be a Weyl algebra in the variables $x_1,..x_n$ and partials $dx_1,..,dx_n$.  Let $f$ 
     be either a polynomial or rational function in the $x_i$ and $m = (m_1,..,m_n)$ a list 
     of nonnegative integers.  The function $f$ may be given as an element of a polynomial ring in the $x_i$
     or of the fraction field of that polynomial ring or of $D$.  This method applies the product of the 
     $dx_i^{m_i}$ to $f$. In the case of the input $(m,g,f,a)$, where $f \neq 0$ and $g$ are both 
     polynomials and $a$ is a nonnegative integer, it applies the product of the $dx_i^{m_i}$ to $g/f^a$ 
     and returns the resulting derivative as (numerator,denominator,power of denominator), not necessarily 
     in lowest terms.
    Example 
     QQ[x,y,z]
     m = {1,1,0}
     f = x^2*y+z^5
     diffRatFun(m,f)
    Example 
     makeWA(QQ[x,y,z])
     m = {1,1,0}
     f = x^2*y+z^5
     diffRatFun(m,f)
    Example
     frac(QQ[x,y])
     m = {1,2}
     f = x/y
     diffRatFun(m,f)
    Example
     makeWA(QQ[x,y,z])
     m = {1,2,1}
     g = z
     f = x*y
     a = 3
     diffRatFun(m,g,f,a)
  Caveat
    Must be over a ring of characteristic $0$.

    annihilator of a polynomial in the Weyl algebra
  Usage
    polynomialAnnihilator f
  Inputs
    f:RingElement
      polynomial
  Outputs
    :Ideal
      the annihilating (left) ideal of @{EM "f"}@ in the Weyl algebra
  Description
    Example
      makeWA(QQ[x,y])
      f = x^2-y^3
      I = polynomialAnnihilator f
  Caveat
    The input f should be an element of a Weyl algebra, and not an element of a commutative polynomial ring.
    However, f should only involve commutative variables.
