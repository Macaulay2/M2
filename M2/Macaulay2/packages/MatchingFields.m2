        MatchingFields
      Headline
        A package for working with matching fields for Grassmannians and partial flag varieties
      Description
        Text
	  A matching field $\Lambda$ for the Grassmannian Gr($k$, $n$), is a simple combinatorial object.
	  It may be thought of as a choice of initial term for each maximal minor of a generic $k \times n$ matrix 
	  of variables. For example, take $k = 2$ and $n = 4$. Let $X = (x_{i,j})$ be a generic $2 \times 4$ matrix of variables. 
	  Suppose that a matching field $\Lambda$ has tuples $\{12, 31, 14, 32, 24, 34\}$. This means that $\Lambda$
	  distinguishes the term $x_{1,1} x_{2,2}$ from the maximal minors on columns $1$ and $2$ of $X$: $x_{1,1} x_{2,2} - x_{1,2} x_{2,1}$.
	  Similarly for the terms $x_{1,3} x_{2,1}$, $x_{1,1} x_{2,4}$, and so on.
	  
	  If the terms of all maximal minors distinguished by a matching field are their initial terms with respect to a fixed weight matrix,
	  then we say that the matching field is coherent. Each such weight matrix induces a weight vector on the Pleucker coordinates of the 
	  Grassmannian. If the initial ideal of the Pleucker ideal of the Grassmannian with respect to this weight vector is a toric ideal,
	  i.e. a prime binomial ideal, then we say that the matching field gives rise to a toric degeneration of the Grassmannian.
	  By a result of Sturmfels (1996), a matching field gives rise to a toric degeneration if and only if the maximal minors of $X$ form
	  a subalgebra basis (or SAGBI basis) with respect to the order induced by the weight matrix.
	  
	  This concept naturally generalises to partial flag varieties under the Pleucker embedding.
	  
	  The MatchingFields package gives basic functions, to construct many of the well-studied examples of matching fields.
	  Given a matching field $L$, it is straight forward to check whether $L$ is coherent, what is a weight matrix that induces it,
	  and whether is gives rise to a toric degeneration. The package also produces polytopes associated to matching fields and Newton-Okounkov bodies.

        I: Ideal
	  The Pleucker ideal associated to the corresponding Grassmannian or partial flag variety
	  with the correct term order given by a weight that induced the matching field
      Description
        Text
	  The Pleucker ideal is the defining ideal of a partial flag variety embedded in a product of Grassmannians, where
	  each Grassmannian is embedded, by the Pleucker embedding, into a suitable projective space.
	  In the case of the Grassmannian Gr($k$, $n$), it is concretely given by kernel of the ring map 
	  $K[P_I : I \subseteq [n],\  |I| = k] \rightarrow K[x_{i,j} : i \in [k], \ j \in [n]]$ where $P_I$ is mapped 
	  to the $k \times k$ maximal minor of the matrix $(x_{i,j})$ whose columns are indexed by the set $I$.
	  It is well-known that this ideal has a Groebner basis consisting of homogeneous quadrics.
	  
	  The function @TO "pleuckerIdeal"@ takes a matching field, either for the Grassmannian or a partial flag variety
	  and outputs the Pleucker ideal for that Grassmannian or partial flag variety. The ambient polynomial ring that
	  contains this ideal is constructed to have the term order induced by the matching field.
	  
	Example
	  L = grMatchingField(2, 4, {{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}})
	  I = pleuckerIdeal L
	  (monoid ring I).Options.MonomialOrder
	  getWeightPleucker L
	
	Text
	  In the above example, the weights for the ambient ring are not the same as the Pleucker weights of the matching field.
	  This is because of the minimum-maximum convention problem. For compatibility with packages such as @TO "Tropical"@, we use
	  the minimum convention in @TO "MatchingFields"@ so the smallest weight with respect to the weight matrix that 
	  induces the matching field is the initial term of a Pleucker form. 
	  However, the monomial ordering given by @TO "Weights"@ uses the 
	  maximum convention, so the ambient ring has weights that are based on the negative of the induced Pleucker Weight.    
	  
	  Note that the given matching field must be coherent. If the matching field is not defined in terms of a weight
	  matrix, then the function will attempt to compute a weight matrix for the matching field. If the matching field is
	  not coherent then the function will produce an error.
        Example
	  L = grMatchingField(2, 4, {{1,2}, {1,3}, {4,1}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}})
	  isCoherent L

        Text
	  The hypersimplex $\Delta(k, n) \subseteq \RR^{n}$ is the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all $k$-subsets
	  of $\{1, \dots, n\}$, and we label each vertex with with its corresponding subset. A regular subdivision of the vertices of $\Delta(k, n)$
	  is said to be matroidal if, for each maximal cell of the subdivision, the subsets labelling its vertices form the set of bases of a matroid.
	  The well-known result is: a point lies in the Dressian Dr($k$, $n$), the tropical prevariety of all $3$-term Pleucker relation in Gr($k$, $n$), if and only if
	  it induces a matroidal subdivision of the hypersimplex.
	Example
	  L = grMatchingField(2, 4, {{1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}})
	  netList matroidSubdivision L -- an octahedron sliced into 2 pieces
	Text
	  Whenever the function @TO "matroidSubdivision"@ is supplied with a Grassmannian matching field, the cached weight that induces the matching field
	  is used for the computation of the matroid subdivision. Note that, if the function is supplied directly with the \textit{pleuckerWeight}, then
	  the coordinates are ordered so that the corresponding sets are listed in reverse lexicographic order.

      Description
        Text
	  Let $V \subseteq \CC^n$ be an affine variety. 
	  The algebraic matroid of $V$ is a matroid whose independent sets $S \subseteq [n]$
	  are the subsets such that the projection from $V$ to the coordinates indexed by $S$
	  is a dominant morphism. Similarly, if $C \subseteq \RR^n$ is a polyhedral cone, then the algebraic matroid
	  of $C$ is the matroid whose independent sets $S \subseteq [n]$ are the subsets such that image of the
	  projection of $C$ onto the coordinates indexed by $S$ is full-dimensional.
	  
	  In the case of the affine cone of Grassmannian under the Pleucker embedding, 
	  there are a few different ways to compute its algebraic matroid. One way is to use its tropicalization.
	  The algebraic matroid of the Grassmannian is equal to the matroid whose bases are the union of all bases of the
	  algebraic matroid for all maximal cones of Trop Gr($k$, $n$).
	  
	  For each coherent matching field, we compute its cone in the tropicalization of the Grassmannian.
	  We compute the algebraic matroid of this cone. To view the bases of this matroid in terms of the $k$-subsets of $[n]$,
	  use the function @TO "algebraicMatroidBases"@. Similarly, to view its circuits use @TO "algebraicMatroidCircuits"@

      Description
        Text
	  This function is the basic constructor for
	  matching fields for partial flag varieties, which we simply call
	  flag matching fields. The function outputs an instance of type @TO "FlMatchingField"@,
	  which represents the flag matching field and stores all data related and 
	  computed about it.
	  
	  There are three basic ways to define a flag matching field. The first way is to
	  supply a weight matrix that induces the flag matching field. This produces a flag matching field
	  for the full flag variety.
	Example
	  M = matrix {{0,0,0,0}, {4,2,3,1}, {10, 40, 30, 20}}
	  L1 = flMatchingField M
	  netList getTuples L1
	  isToricDegeneration L1
	Text
	  In the above example, we construct the flag matching field for the full
	  flag variety induced by the given weight matrix. The tuples for the 
	  flag matching field are listed by their size. Similarly to Grassmannian
	  matching fields: @TO "GrMatchingField"@, the function @TO "isToricDegeneration"@
	  checks the equality of the @TO "matchingFieldIdeal"@ and the initial ideal
	  of the @TO "pleuckerIdeal"@ with respect to the weight of the matching field.
	  
	  The second way to define a flag matching field
	  is to supply a weight matrix and specify the size of the sets
	  or, in other words, specify the dimensions of the vector spaces in the flags.
	Example
	  L2 = flMatchingField({1,2}, M)
	  netList getTuples L2
	Text
	  The third way to define a flag matching field is by listing out its tuples.
	Example
	  T = getTuples L1
	  L3 = flMatchingField({1,3}, 4, {T_0, T_2})
	  getTuples L3
	  isCoherent L3
	  getWeightMatrix L3
	Text
	  As shown in the example above, the first argument "kList" 
	  specifies the size of the sets.
	  The third argument is a list whose i-th entry is a list of tuples
	  of size "kList_i". In this example, the size of the sets are 1 and 3, 
	  which correspond to "T_0" and "T_2".
	  When a flag matching field is constructed in this way, it is not
	  guaranteed to be coherent, i.e., it may not be induced by a weight matrix.
	  Similarly to Grassmannian matching fields, the function @TO "isCoherent"@
	  checks whether the matching field is coherent and the function @TO "getWeightMatrix"@
	  returns a weight matrix that induces the matching field, if it exists.
	  If the matching field is not coherent, then these methods produce an error.
	  
	  A note of caution. Two different weight matrices may induce the same matching field
	  so the function @TO "getWeightMatrix"@ may return a weight matrix that is
	  different to what may be expected. However, if a matching field is defined 
	  by a weight matrix, then that weight matrix will be returned.

      Description
        Text
	  A matching field $\Lambda$ for the Grassmannian Gr$(k,n)$ associates to each subset $J = \{j_1 < \dots < j_k\}$
	  an ordering of that subset $\Lambda(J) = (j_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, j_{\sigma(k)})$ for some permutation $\sigma \in S_k$.
	  The monomial map associated to a matching field $\Lambda$ is defined as the map that sends each Pleucker 
	  coordinate $p_J$ to the monomial sgn$(\sigma)x_{1, \Lambda(J)_1} x_{2, \Lambda(J)_2} \cdots x_{k, \Lambda(J)_k}$ 
	  where sgn$(\sigma) \in \{+1, -1\}$ is the sign of the permutation. The matching field
	  ideal is the kernel of this monomial map.
	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField(2, 4)
	  m = matchingFieldRingMap L
	  I = matchingFieldIdeal L
	  ker m === I
	Text
	  The analogous setup holds for flag matching fields. A flag matching field can be thought of as a union of Grassmannian matching fields.
	  The inclusion of the Grassmannian matching field naturally extends to an inclusion of the corresponding ideals.
	  The flag matching field ideals are also generated by 'incident relations' that involve Pleucker coordinates from distinct pairs of
	  Grassmannians within the flag variety.
	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField({1,2}, 4)
	  I = matchingFieldIdeal L
        Text
	  The functions @TO "matchingFieldIdeal"@ and @TO "pleuckerIdeal"@ both construct ideals that belong to the same
	  polynomial ring. Similarly, the ring maps constructed by the function @TO "pleuckerMap"@ and @TO "matchingFieldRingMap"@
	  have the same target ring. 
	Example
	  I' = pleuckerIdeal L
	  ring I === ring I'
	  source pleuckerMap L
	  source pleuckerMap L === source matchingFieldRingMap L
	  target pleuckerMap L
	  target pleuckerMap L === target matchingFieldRingMap L
	Text
	  The option @TO "Strategy"@ determines how the matching field ideal is computed. The default uses the package @TO "FourTiTwo"@. This strategy works
	  by passing in the matrix of the toric ideal to @TO "toricGroebner"@ with the correct weight vector. In the case of Grassmannian matching fields,
	  the columns of the matrix of the toric ideal are exactly the vertices of the matching field polytope. For a flag matching field $\Lambda$, 
	  the matrix of the toric ideal is the top-justified juxtaposition of such matrices for the Grassmannian matching fields contained in $\Lambda$.
	  On the other hand, the strategy "M2" simply uses the in-built function to compute the kernel of the map @TO "matchingFieldRingMap"@.	  
      Caveat
        For some versions of the package @TO "FourTiTwo"@, the strategy "4ti2" may not correctly take into account the weights. See the caveat in the
	documentation of the function @TO "toricGroebner"@. If there are any problems, it may be more reliable to use the option "M2".

	  Each matching field defines a projective toric variety whose defining

	  The coordinate ring of this toric variety is the Ehrhart ring of 
	  the matching field polytope. Note that for flag matching fields, the
	  toric variety is embedded into a high-dimensional
	  projective space via the Segre embedding whose domain is a product of
	  Grassmannians.
	  
	  Given a matching field $\Lambda$ for the Grassmannian Gr$(k,n)$, the matching field 
	  polytope $P(\Lambda)$ is simply the convex hull of the exponent
	  vectors of the image of Pleucker variables under the monomial map of 
	  $\Lambda$. The polytope natrually lives in the space
	  $\RR^{k \times n}$.
	Example
	  L2 = diagonalMatchingField(2, 4)
	  P2 = matchingFieldPolytope L2
	  fVector P2
	  vertices P2
	Text
	  The columns of the above matrix are the vertices of the matching field
	  polytope $P(\Lambda)$. Each column should be thought of as a $2 \times 4$ 
	  matrix whose entries are listed row by row.
	  
	  A matching field $\Lambda$ for a partial flag variety Fl$(k_1, \dots, k_s; n)$ is a union of matching 
	  fields $\Lambda = \bigcup \Lambda_i$ for some Grassmannians. The matching field polytope for a
	  partial flag variety is the
	  Minkowski sum $P(\Lambda) = \sum P(\Lambda_i)$ of Grassmannian matching field polytopes in $\Lambda$.
	  For this sum to make sense, each Grassmannian matching field polytope
	  must be put into the same space, which is taken to be $\RR^{k_{\max} \times n}$
	  where $k_{\max} = \max\{k_i\}$ is the largest $k$ such that there is a Grassmannian matching field
	  for Gr$(k,n)$ contained in $\Lambda$. If $v \in \RR^{k_i \times n}$ is a vertex for a
	  Grassmannian matching field polytope, then we embed $v$ into $\RR^{k_{\max} \times n}$
	  by joining a suitably sized matrix of zeros to $v$ from below.
	  
	  Embedding a Grassmannian matching field polytope into a higher dimensional space as
	  described is done by specifying the optional value @TO "ExtraZeroRows"@.
	Example
	  L1 = diagonalMatchingField(1, 4)
	  P1 = matchingFieldPolytope(L1, ExtraZeroRows => 1)
	  vertices P1

	  vertices P12
	Text
	  The above example constructs the diagonal matching field polytope for
	  the partial flag variety Fl$(1, 2; 4)$ as a Minkowski sum. 
	  The quick way to do this is as follows.

	  L = diagonalMatchingField({1,2}, 4)	
    	  Q = matchingFieldPolytope L

	  of matching fields and the maximum convention of initial terms in @TO "Macaulay2"@.
	  	
	  The ring map for the Pleucker embedding of a partial flag variety is
	  completely analogous.

        Text
          The monomial order on the ring of Pleucker variables, 
	  shown above, is also based on $-1 \times W$. More concretely,
	  the weight vector of a Pleucker variable $P_J$ is the weight of 
	  the initial term of the image of the Pleucker variable $m(P_J) = \det(X_J)$ under the map.
	  
	  The monomial map associated to the matching field, see @TO "matchingFieldRingMap"@ 
	  is the map that sends each
	  Pleucker variable $P_J \mapsto \rm{in}(\det(X_J))$ to the lead term of the
	  maximal minor $\det(X_J)$.

	  the cone of weight matrices that induce the matching field
      Description
        Text
          Given a coherent matching field $\Lambda$, either for the Grassmannian or partial flag variety,
	  the set of weight matrices that induce $\Lambda$ naturally form a polyhedral cone.
	  The function @TO "weightMatrixCone"@ constructs this cone by writing down a collection of inequalities.
	  To illustrate this assume that $(1,2)$ is a tuple of $\Lambda$. A weight matrix $M = (m_{i,j})$ 
	  induces a matching field with the tuple $(1,2)$ if and only if $m_{1,1} + m_{2,2} < m_{1,2} + m_{2,1}$.
	  Continuing in this way for all other tuples of $\Lambda$ produces the cone of weight matrices.
	  Note, the inequalities, like the one above, are strict. So, in general, only the interior points of 
	  the cone give rise to generic weight matrices that induce the matching field.
	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField(2, 4)
	  C = weightMatrixCone L  
	  rays C
	  linealitySpace C
	  dim C
	Text
	  In the above example, we can see that adding a vector from the lineality space 
	  can be interpreted as adding a constant to each element in a specific row or column 
	  of the weight matrix.
	  
	  For matching fields that are not originally defined by a weight matrix, the cone of weight matrices
	  allows us to test if the matching field is coherent. The matching field is coherent if and only if
	  the cone is full dimensional. This is the strategy implemented by the function @TO "isCoherent"@.
        Example
	  L = grMatchingField(2, 3, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}})
	  isCoherent L
	  dim weightMatrixCone L
	Text
	  In the example above, the cone naturally lives in $\RR^6$ so it is not full dimensional.
	  Therefore, the matching field is not coherent.

	  Let $M_0 \in \RR^{k \times n}$ be a matrix that induced the diagonal matching field.
	  Usually, we take this matrix to be $(m_{i,j})$ with $m_{i,j} = (n-j)n^(i-2)$ if $i > 1$ and $m_{i,j} = 0$ if $i = 1$.
	  Note that this matrix is different to the weight matrix of the matching field produced by the function @TO "diagonalMatchingField"@,
	  however the matching fields are the same. 
	  Given a permutation $\sigma \in S_n$, the matching field associated to $\sigma$ has weight matrix
	  $M_\sigma$, which is the same as $M_0$ except in the second row, which is given by $\sigma(1), \sigma(2), \dots, \sigma(n)$.
	  If $\sigma = (n, n-1, \dots, 1) \in S_n$ is the permutation written in single-line notation, then the matching field induced by $M_\sigma$ is
	  the diagonal matching field.
	Example
	  L0 = diagonalMatchingField(3, 6) 
	  getWeightMatrix L0
	  L1 = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {6,5,4,3,2,1})
	  getWeightMatrix L1
	  L0 == L1
	  L2 = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {1,3,2,6,4,5})
	  getWeightMatrix L2
	  L3 = matchingFieldFromPermutation({1,2,3}, 6, {1,4,2,3,6,5})
	  getWeightMatrix L3
	Text
	  The optional argument @TO "RowNum"@ is used to change which row of $M_0$ is permuted.
	Example
	  L4 = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {1,4,2,3,6,5}, RowNum => 3)
	  getWeightMatrix L4
	Text
	  The optional argument @TO "UsePrimePowers"@ is used to modify the original diagonal weight matrix $M_0$. If
	  the option is set to true then we use the matrix with entries $m_{i,j} = (n-j) p^(i-2)$ if $i>1$ and $m_{i,j} = 0$
	  if $i = 1$, where $p \ge n$ is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to $n$.
        Example
	  L5 = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {1,3,2,4,6,5}, UsePrimePowers => true)
	  getWeightMatrix L5
	Text
	  The optional argument @TO "PowerValue"@ is used to give a specific value to $p$ in the diagonal weight matrix
	  as described above. If the value is not positive, then the argument is ignored. This option should be used carefully.
	  If the power value is set incorrectly (typically by setting a value that is too low) then the weight matrix may not be {\it generic},
	  i.e., it does not define a matching field. However, in such a case, the function produces a matching field without error, 
	  as shown in the example $L7$ below. Working with such matching fields may lead to unexpected behaviours.
	Example
	  L6 = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {1,3,2,4,6,5}, PowerValue => 10)
	  getWeightMatrix L6
	  L7 = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {5,4,3,2,1,0}, PowerValue => 1)
	  getWeightMatrix L7
	Text
	  Any positive integer supplied to the argument @TO "PowerValue"@ takes precedence over @TO "UsePrimePowers"@. 
	  The optional argument @TO "ScalingCoefficient"@ is used to scale the entries of the row that is permuted by the permutation.
	  If @TO "UsePrimePowers"@ is set to true, and $p \ge n$ is the smallest prime number less than $n$, then the scaling coefficient
	  can be set to any $c \in \{1, 2, \dots, p-1\}$ and the resulting weight matrix is guaranteed to be generic.
	Example
	  L8 = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {6,1,5,2,3,4}, UsePrimePowers => true, ScalingCoefficient => 3)
	  getWeightMatrix L8
	  isToricDegeneration L8

	  the Grassmannian Gr$(3, 6)$.

      Description
        Text
	  The Pleucker algebra is generated by Pleucker forms given by top-justified
	  minors of a generic matrix. The Pleucker algebra can be constructed with
	  the function @TO "subring"@, of the image of the Pleucker ring map that can be
	  accessed with the function @TO "pleuckerMap"@. Note that the ambient ring
	  containg the Pleucker algebra has a weight-based term order that comes from
	  the matching field. We compute a subalgebra basis (SAGBI basis) using the
	  package @TO "SubalgebraBases"@ for the Pleucker algebra.
	  
	  The Newton-Okounkov body of the matching field is contructed from this subalgebra basis.
	  In the case of Grassmannian matching fields, the NO body is simply the convex
	  hull of the exponent vectors of the initial terms of the subalgebra basis.
	  If the matching field gives rise to a toric degeneration (see the function @TO "isToricDegeneration"@)
	  then the NO body coincides with the matching field polytope
	  (see @TO "matchingFieldPolytope"@) because the maximal minors form a subalgebra basis for the Pleucker algebra.
	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField(2, 4)
	  P = matchingFieldPolytope L
	  vertices P
	  noBody = NOBody L
	  vertices noBody
	  P == noBody
	Text
	  In the case of flag matching fields, the NO body is computed in a similar way.
	  First a subalgebra basis is computed for the Pleucker algebra.
	  However, to construct the NO body from the subalgebra basis, we need to take into account 
	  the grading on the Pleucker forms. From the geometric persepctive, we are simply using the
	  Segre embedding to view the flag variety as a subvariety of a suitably large projective space.
	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField({1,2}, 4)
	  noBody = NOBody L
	  vertices noBody
	  noBody == matchingFieldPolytope L
	Text
	  Note that the matching field polytope is equal to the NO body if and only if the matching field
	  gives rise to a toric degeneration. So, for a {\it hexagonal matching field} for Gr$(3,6)$, the
	  NO body has an additional vertex. We construct a hexagonal matching field using the fucntion
	  @TO "matchingFieldFromPermutation"@ as follows.

	  L = matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {6,1,5,2,3,4}, UsePrimePowers => true, ScalingCoefficient => 3)

	  @TO "matchingFieldFromPermutation"@, which constructs a matching field by permuting a row (usually the second row)
	  of a weight matrix that gives rise to the diagonal matching field.
	  
          If the option @TO "UsePrimePowers"@ is set to true, then the underlying {\it diagonal} weight matrix is given by
	  $M_0 = (m_{i,j})$ with $m_{i,j} = (n-j) p^(i-2)$ if $i > 1$ and $m_{i,j} = 0$ if $i = 1$, where
	  $p \ge n$ is the smallest prime number greater than or equal to $n$.
	Example
	  getWeightMatrix matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {1,2,3,4,5,6}, UsePrimePowers => false)
	  getWeightMatrix matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {1,2,3,4,5,6}, UsePrimePowers => true)
    	Text
	  To set the value of $p$ in the above matrix to a specific value, use the option @TO "PowerValue"@.
	Example
	  getWeightMatrix matchingFieldFromPermutation(3, 6, {1,2,3,4,5,6}, PowerValue => 10)
      	Text
	  The option @TO "PowerValue"@ overrides the option @TO "UsePrimePowers"@. 
	  
	  {\bf Warning.} Certain values for the option @TO "PowerValue"@ will produce weight matrices that are
	  not {\it generic}, i.e., the initial term of the corresponding Pleucker forms are not all monomials, 
	  hence the weight matrix does not define a matching field. The function @TO "matchingFieldFromPermutation"@ will
	  produce a matching field, which may lead to unexpected behaviours. 
	  
	  {\bf Precise details.} The value of $p$ is determined as follows. 
	  The option @TO "PowerValue"@ is used if it is a positive value. If @TO "PowerValue"@ is not positive
	  then the function checks to see if the option @TO "UsePrimePowers"@ is set to true. If it is, then
	  the value of $p$ is set to be the small prime number greater than or equal to $n$. Otherwise, if
	  @TO "UsePrimePowers"@ is set to false, then $p$ is set to be $n$.

	  The diagonal matching field is defined to be the matching field
	  whose tuples are all in ascending order. It is a coherent matching field
	  so it is induced by a weight matrix.
	  
	  The weight matrix used to construct the diagonal matching field us given by

	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField(3, 6)
	  getWeightMatrix L
	Text
	  The function @TO "diagonalMatchingField"@ can be used in three different ways.
	  If it is supplied two integers $(k,n)$ then it produces the diagonal matching field
	  for the Grassmannian, as shown in the above example.
	  If it is supplied a single integer $n$, then it produces the diagonal matching field
	  for the full flag variety. The matching fields of the full flag variety have tuples of
	  size $1, 2, \dots, n-1$.
	  The function can be made to produce diagonal matching fields for partial flag varieties
	  by supplying it a list $kList$ and integer $n$. The sizes of the tuples are the entries
	  of $kList$.
	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField 4;
	  netList getTuples L
	  L = diagonalMatchingField({1, 2}, 5);
    	  netList getTuples L
	Text
	  Diagonal matching fields always give rise to toric degenerations
	  of Grassmannians and flag varieties. In the literature, 
	  this toric degeneration is also known as Gelfand-Tsetlin
	  degeneration. The matching field polytopes for the diagonal matching field, 
	  which can be constructed with the function @TO "matchingFieldPolytope"@,
	  are unimodularly equivalent to Gelfand-Tsetlin polytopes.

	  the sign of the permutation that permutes $J$ into ascending order. Equivalently,
	  $c = (-1)^d$ where $d = |\{(a, b) \in [k]^2 : a < b, j_a > j_b \}|$ is the number of descents of
	  $J$. The monomial $m(J)$ is the lead term of the correponding Pleucker form with respect to the
	  weight order given by the matching field.

      Description
        Text
	  Suppose that a coherent matching field is induced by a $k \times n$ weight matrix $M$.
	  The Pleucker forms are minors of a generic matrix of variables. For example, for the Grassmannian
	  the Pleucker forms are the maximal minors. The weight matrix $M$ is {\it generic}, which is equivalent
	  to the property: the initial form of each Pleucker form with respect to $M$ is a monomial.
	  The weight of the initial term of each Pleucker form is the induced weight on the ring in the Pleucker
	  variables, which is given by the function @TO "getWeightPleucker"@. By convention, the Pleucker variables
	  are listed such that their subsets are in RevLex order, which is the order given by the function @TO "subsets"@.
	  
	  An equivalent formulation is: the Pleucker weight vector is the tuple of tropical determinants of $M$, also
	  known as the image of $M$ under the {\it tropical Stiefel map} (or its natural generalisation to partial
	  flag varieties).
        Example

	  This function is the basic constructor for Grassmannian
	  matching fields. The function outputs an instance of type @TO "GrMatchingField"@,
	  which represents the matching field and stores all data related and 
	  computed about it.
	  
	  There are two basic ways to define a Grassmannian matching field. The first way is to
	  supply a weight matrix that induces the matching field. This produces a coherent matching field
	  and is well-defined if the matrix is {\it generic}.
	Example
	  M = matrix {{0,0,0,0,0,0}, {1,6,2,5,3,4}, {60,50,10,20,40,30}}
	  L1 = grMatchingField M
	  getTuples L1
	  isToricDegeneration L1
	Text
	  In the above example, we construct the Grassmannian matching field 
	  induced by the given weight matrix. The tuples for the 
	  matching field are listed in RevLex order. The function @TO "isToricDegeneration"@
	  checks the equality of the @TO "matchingFieldIdeal"@ and the initial ideal
	  of the @TO "pleuckerIdeal"@ with respect to the weight inducing the matching field.
	  
	  The second way to define a Grassmannian matching field
	  is to list out its tuples.
	Example
	  T = {{1,4}, {2,4}, {3,4}, {3,1}, {3,2}, {1,2}}
	  L2 = grMatchingField(2, 4, T)
	  getTuples L2
	  isCoherent L2
	  getWeightMatrix L2
	Text
	  As shown in the example above, the first argument "k" 
	  specifies the size of the tuples.
	  The third argument is a list of the tuples.
	  Note that the tuples can be supplied in any order. 
	  If the list of tuples is not correct, i.e. if some are missing or duplicated then 
	  the function raises an error.
	  When a Grassmannian matching field is constructed in this way, it is not
	  guaranteed to be coherent, i.e., it may not be induced by a weight matrix.
	  The function @TO "isCoherent"@
	  checks whether the matching field is coherent and the function @TO "getWeightMatrix"@
	  returns a weight matrix that induces the matching field, if it exists.
	  If the matching field is not coherent, then these methods produce an error.
	  
	  A note of caution. Two different weight matrices may induce the same matching field
	  so the function @TO "getWeightMatrix"@ may return a weight matrix that is
	  different to what may be expected. However, if a matching field is defined 
	  by a weight matrix, then that weight matrix will be returned.

        A tope field structure on a matching field
      Description
        Text
	  Tope fields were introduced in the study of tropical oriented matroids 
	  and have been used generalise and study matching fields. In this package we follow the conventions
	  of tope fields given by Smith and Loho, i.e., the type of a tope field contains positive entries. 
	  
	  The combinatorial data of a tope field is given by a matching field for $Gr(k,n)$ together with a type: $(t_1, \dots, t_s)$
	  where $t_1 + \dots + t_s = k$ and each $t_i$ is a positive integer. The bipartite graphs of the tope field are encoded in the
	  tuples of the matching field as follows. Let $(i_{1,1}, i_{1,2}, \dots i_{1,t_1}, i_{2,1}, \dots, i_{s, t_s})$ be a tuple of the 
	  matching field, the bipartite graph on vertices $L := [n]$ and $R := [s]$ has edges $\{i_{j, t}, j\}$ where $j \in [s]$ and $t \in [t_j]$.
	  
	  For example, if $(1,3,2)$ is a tuple of a matching field for $Gr(3,4)$ of a tope field of type $(2,1)$, then corresponding bipartite graph on
	  vertices $L = [4]$ and $R = [2]$ has edges: $E = \{11, 31, 22 \}$.
	  
	  The TopeField type in this package is a HashTable that stores the matching field and type. A tope field can be defined from a matching field
	  using the constructor @TO "topeField"@. New tope fields can be constructed from old using the function @TO "amalgamation"@. Note that
	  amalgamation is only defined for linkage tope field, see @TO "isLinkage"@.

        Test if a tope field is linkage
      Usage
        result = isLinkage MF
	result = isLinkage TF
      Inputs
        MF: GrMatchingField

      Outputs
        result: Boolean
      Description
        Text
	  Consider a tope field given by a collection of bipartite graphs.
	  The tope field is said to be linkage if for each $k+1$-subset $S$ of $[n]$, the union of the edges of the bipartite graphs
	  $G$ where the non-isolated left-vertices of $G$ are contained in $S$, is a forest.
	  
	  Note that all coherent matching fields are linkage.
	Example
	  L = diagonalMatchingField(2,4);
	  isLinkage L
