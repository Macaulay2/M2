SYSTEMS/	-- examples of systems of polynomials: 
		-- load "SYSTEM/examplename.m2" makes F = list of polynomials
TST/		-- tests loaded by the package via TEST, other tests

PHCpack/        -- interface wrappers for PHCpack

Bertini/        -- interface wrappers for Bertini

hom4ps2_in_out	-- a helper script for HOM4PS2 wrapper
		-- TO DO: check if still works... Does anybody want to develop an interface?

certifiedNAG.m2 -- implementation of the algorithm from 
		-- Beltran, Leykin. "Robust certified numerical homotopy continuation"
		-- (not connected to the package)

benchmarks.m2	-- a script used to benchmark internal and external 0-dim solvers
		-- TO DO: move examples to  SYSTEMS/, create BENCHMARKS/ ???

showcase.m2 	-- interesting examples
		-- TO DO: split up in several "topics", create SHOWCASE/ ???
