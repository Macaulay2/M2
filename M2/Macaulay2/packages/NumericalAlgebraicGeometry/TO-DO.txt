--- NEAR FUTURE ---
engine track:

  DMat submatrix operations
  (A,B are submatrices given by a rectangular window; c is a scalar) 
    set_zero(A), copy i.e. A=B, A+=B, 
    A *= c 
    A = c*B
    A += c*B 
  )
  MatOps vs MatrixOps???  


adaptive precision:

  proposed heuristic? if (log(cond number) + log(rel.error) + safety bits?) > precision then status =  INCREASE_PRECISION
                      decide when to decrease?  

  mechanism: (1) engine returns with a flag "increase/decrease" precision
             (2) M2 code decides what to do: 
                 for example, the current approximation for x gets promoted to CC_prec where prec is new precision 
              	 also, create a (rawEvaluatorK?) evaluator for the homotopy with the new precision 


--- ISSUES ---

Normalize=>true: is probably a good default for the blackbox... but causes checks to fail in NumericalSchubertCalculus

movePoints: fails if the new points are not regular -- there should be a blackbox combining endgame/refine before this is fixed

isSolution?

isOn: merge two versions?

numericalIntersection: need to handle witness sets with ProjectionDimension key

engine track: problem with the origin (change handling relative error tolerance, see witness-set examples)

NAGtrace: separate "progress update" from other "talk"?

hypersurfaceSection does not remove junk

numericalIrreducibleDecomposition fails on a singular point: e.g., ideal(x_1^2,x_2^2,x_3^3)

movePoints should take a list of Points

deflation needs work

points WitnessSet -- should return list of Points not list of lists (check if external packages use it)

decompose -- still not robust for nonreduced components
