movePoints: fails if the new points are not regular -- there should be a blackbox combining endgame/refine before this is fixed

isSolution?

numericalIntersection: need to handle witness sets with ProjectionDimension key

engine track: problem with the origin (change handling relative error tolerance, wee witness-set examples)

isOn: merge two versions?

NAGtrace: separate "progress update" from other "talk"

NAGtrace: unhook gbTrace

hypersurfaceSection does not remove junk

numericalIrreducibleDecomposition fails on a singular point: e.g., ideal(x_1^2,x_2^2,x_3^3)

movePoints should take a list of Points

deflation needs work

points WitnessSet -- should return list of Points not list of lists (check if external packages use it)

decompose -- still not robust for nonreduced components
