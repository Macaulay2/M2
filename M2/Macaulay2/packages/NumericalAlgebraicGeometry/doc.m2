    Description
    	Text 
            @TO GateMatrix@ {\tt M} is expected to have 1 column.
    	    Matrices {\tt params} and {\tt variables} are expected to have 1 row.
        Example
            variables = declareVariable \ {x,y}
    	    F = gateSystem(matrix{variables}, matrix{{x*y-1},{x^3+y^2-2}})
	    evaluate(F,point{{0.1,0.2+ii}}) 
	    evaluate(F,point{{1/2,1/3}})
	    evaluate(F,point{{2_(ZZ/101),3}})
	Text
	    Systems with parameters are allowed. 
	Example    
	    params = declareVariable \ {a,b}  
	    Fab = gateSystem(matrix{params}, matrix{variables}, matrix{{a*x*y-1},{x^3+y^2-b}})
	    evaluate(Fab,point{{1,2}},point{{0.1,0.2+ii}})
    Caveat
        Note for developers: there is a version of the constructor that builds @TO GateSystem@ from @TO PolySystem@. 
	Its variant that takes the list of variables to treat as parameters is likely to disappear.

    Description
        Text
    	    This method implements homotopy continuation: it follows a given list {\tt S} of start solutions along a @TO Homotopy@ {\tt H}.
	  
            Option @TO Field@ is unique to this method (the default is @TO CC@, but one can imagine using @TO RR@). 
	    It specifies which @TO InexactFieldFamily@ to use when adaptive precision is requested via {\tt Precision=>infinity}.
	    The rest are a subset of @TO "numerical homotopy tracking options"@. 
    Caveat	
            Note for developers: the old implementation @TO track@ eventually will be replaced by a call to @TO trackHomotopy@.
	    Alternative ways for calling ({\tt H} could be a Sequence (a preSLP), Matrix, etc.) are deprecated and are for debugging purposes only.

    a system of functions evaluated via a straightline program
  Description
    Text
      An object of this type is a system of functions evaluated via an SLP 
      that is constructed using the tools of package @TO SLPexpressions@.
      
      An object of this type (constructed with @TO gateSystem@) 
      is a @TO System@ of functions represented via a @TO GateMatrix@.
      In particular, polynomial systems and systems of rational functions can be represented this way.
	        
      Unlike @TO PolySystem@, the functions of a @TO GateSystem@ do not belong to a ring and can be evaluated on @TO Number@s and @TO RingElement@s 
      as long as the constants in the evaluation circuits can be promoted to the corresponding @TO Ring@s.
