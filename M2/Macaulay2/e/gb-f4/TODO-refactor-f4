For week of June 12, 2023:
    a. MonomialHashTable
    b. Mike: do (first versino of) the translation from M2 matrices to a Basis/list of polynomials/vectrs
       Basis (at least a simple version)
    c. Monomial lookup table
    d. SPairs
    e. Macaulay Matrix build
    f. Macaulay Matrix reduction

To be done for GB F4 parallel.

[ ] MonomialHashTable for ring monomials for repesenting a single monomial in
    a polynomial or a column of a macaulay matrix
    (but in either case, we need the component)
[ ] Monomial lookup table for divisibility
    this is used in Macaulay Matrix Build
    should this build directly the quotient monomial?
    What is the right data structure for cache friendly divisibility structure?
[ ] SPairs
    set of spairs
    spair removal criteria (*)
    choice of next set of spairs
    pre-spairs: minimize, then get spairs.
[ ] Macaulay Matrix build (uses monomial hash table)
    a hash table (component, monomial index) --> (column, which row reduces it)
    this should be usable for different primes
[ ] CRA of integers, rational reconstruction
[ ] Macaulay Matrix reduction (over a single prime) PARALLEL
[ ] Basis of polynomials (uses monomial hash table)
    enum class for type of a basis element
    never remove an index.  If a GB element becomes non-minimal, retire it.
    
Handle:
    inhomogeneity
    quotient rings, exterior algebra:
      spair handling/creation
    Hilbert function use (homogeneous case)
    lifting to QQ and hopefully also to QQ(alpha) number fields. PARALLEL
    Weyl algebra case should work.
    handle sparse monomials
    handle partial output (up to a given degree or degrees)

Should be as parallel as possible
