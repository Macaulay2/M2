# linking givaro as a shared library is bad, because then under Mac OS X its static constructors
# get run before ours do, and it calls our "operator new", which calls GC_malloc, before we've
# had a chance to initialize it.

# Disable vectorized instructions: SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2:
# (this is needed if we wish to distribute binaries to others.  But it might be bad
# for us if we don't.  So the configure script should have an option for that.)
