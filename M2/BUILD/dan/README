Ubuntu 12 hint:

    I was working on Ubuntu 12.04, but I had to upgrade on Ubuntu 11.10, and, after some difficulties I find a solution to intall correctly M2 :
    1) I first get the  "libpari2-gmp" debian package at http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/p/pari/
    2) I install the  "libgmp3c2" package with an apt-get install
    3) I do a dpkg on the "libpari2-gmp" package
    4) A succesfully make an "apt-get install macaulay2".

HTML validation:

    Under Ubuntu, install w3c-markup-validator and run it from the command line with
    the script at http://github.com/ysangkok/w3c-validator-runner, and run that with this
    script:

	#! /bin/bash
	TMP="/tmp/validate-$$"
	exec >&2
	find "$1" -name \*.html |
	   while read x
	   do validator-runner.py "$x" > $TMP
	      if [ -s $TMP ]
	      then echo
		   echo " *** $x"
		   cat $TMP
	      fi
	   done
