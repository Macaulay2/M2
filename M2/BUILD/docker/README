Docker is a software for building, shipping, or running applications on different
platforms. Each folder contains a Dockerfile which contains a guide to building 
Macaulay2 on that specific platform, regardless of your current platform.

Use cases:
 - build an RPM package for an arbitrary version of Fedora Linux from any platform.
 - run the latest version of Macaulay2 on any OS that runs Docker (including Mac, Windows, etc.).
 - develop Macaulay2 by running it on different libraries or kernels simultaneously.
 - run any number of threads of the latest version of Macaulay2 in the cloud efficiently.

Step 1: Build a Macaulay2-in-a-container:
  Change to the directory for the target platform and run: (as any user)
    $ make

Step 2: Run Macaulay2-in-a-container:
  Simply run:
    $ make run
  More generally you can use:
    $ docker run --rm -ti m2-fedora

Optional Step 3: Access files and packages
  If you wish to access the files and packages in the M2 directory within the container run: (as root)
    # docker run --rm -ti -v m2-folder:/M2 m2-fedora M2
  Then on a separate terminal run:
    # ln -s /var/lib/docker/volumes/m2-folder/_data m2-folder
    # cd m2-folder
  Note that changes here are not permanent by default, but Docker can be configured to do so.

Optional Step 4: Connect with Emacs
  Add this line to the end of your .emacs-Macaulay2 file:
    (setq M2-exe "docker run --rm -ti m2-fedora")
  Alternatively, to change this temporarily you can change the shortcut that runs Macaulay2:
    press  C-u f12
    replace "M2" in the beginning of the line with:
      docker run --rm -ti m2-fedora
