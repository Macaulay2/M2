The only place the Macaulay2 version number appears is in the file ./VERSION .

We have three main branches on github:

   development -- all pull requests are merged into this branch
   pre-master  -- development is manually merged into this branch occasionally, triggering builds
   master      -- pre-master is manually merged into this branch after builds succeed there.  Daily builds occcur here.

The development branch will always be ahead of the pre-master branch, and the pre-master branch will always be ahead of
the master branch, so the merges above are all done by fast-fowarding.

Near release time we have a release branch, with name of the form release-X.Y-branch, which is occasionally merged into development.

The convention for version numbers of Macaulay2 is this:
  1.18     : a major release, such as occurs every 6-12 months, stable, made into binary distributions
  1.18.1   : a minor update, with changes people might want, stable, suitable
     	     minor updates to binary distributions on certain architectures
  1.18.1.1 : a development version, with no binary distributions

Here is the procedure:

    Things to do when incrementing the version number to X.Y.Z, say :
	 - increment the version number in the file ./VERSION
	 - add an entry to distributions/deb/changelog
	 - commit the two files and push upstream

    Things to do when developing a binary release for version X.Y (or version X.Y.Z)
       - on the development branch:
	 - increment version to X.Y, as described above
	 - make a git branch of the form release-X.Y and switch to it
	      git branch -b release-X.Y-branch
	 - push it upstream:
	      git push -u origin release-X.Y
	 - tag provisionally it for Mahrud
	      git tag release-X.Y-rc1
	      git push origin release-X.Y-rc1
	 - switch to development and merge the new release branch with development
	      git checkout development
	      git merge release-X.Y
	 - update version to X.Y.0.1 on the development branch, as described above
	      
         Prepare binary releases on the release-X.Y branch, committing minor
         changes needed for building on various architectures.  Periodically
         merge the branch into the development branch.  Continue accepting pull
         requests into the development branch.

Note:
  Debian distributions may append a "downstream" debian release number N to the version number: X.Y.Z-N
  See distributions/deb/Makefile.in, where we allow for that, as a way to fix badly prepared binary distributions.
