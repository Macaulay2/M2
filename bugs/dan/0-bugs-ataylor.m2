prune and minPres should both be synonyms of minimalPresentation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

minPres still needs to have how it deals with monomial orders 
repaired.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

synonyms are not highlighting in emacs, they are also, not currently 
given in the index for documentation.  This needs to be fixed.

I think that res should take users directly to the main node for 
resolution and on the main page synonyms should be listed.  This 
is also how I will write the minimalPresentation page, with synonyms 
prune and minPres - both of these absolutly need links in the index.
