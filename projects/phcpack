    Dear Mike, Dan, and David,

    thanks for your email and your interest in using
    numerical algebraic geometry in Macaulay 2.

    Currently PHCpack is already available as one of
    the experimental packages in SAGE.  Kathy Piret
    has collaborated with William Stein on this.
    As my knowledge of Python has increased this semester,
    I have plans to polish the PHClib C code and merge it
    into a Python module in the winter break.
    We use the PHClib C code in the binding with MPI,
    used in collaboration with Anton and Yun Guan.
    Yun Guan has used the MPI toolbox for Octave,
    when we developed PHClab.  And of course, there
    is PHCmaple, now being further developed by Anton.
    Deflation is already implemented in PHCpack
    -- both in symbolic and in algorithmic form --
    although its use of linear algebra should be improved.
    PHCpack is open source (using gcc) and I distribute
    executable versions for many platforms -- the
    most recent version (PHCv2.3.34 is about to come out)
    will also run directly on the MacIntel.

    Writing an interface from Macaulay 2 to PHCpack should
    be -- at least at first -- a project that one student
    could handle (like PHClab and PHCmaple).  I am CC-ing
    Anton in this email, because he knowns both Macaulay 2
    and PHCpack quite well and he could be the most suitable
    person to bring such a project then to the next level.

    I would be happy to guide an RA during a summer.
    As the NSF recently awarded me a new grant, I am not
    sure if it would be good for me to commit time on
    your grant as a co-PI, but I am willing to write
    a letter in which I promise to help guiding a grad
    student in building an interface from Macaulay 2 to
    PHCpack, and then -- as I always try to do now --
    be very responsive to any kind of bugs that will surface.

    Just let me know if you would need a letter from me
    and when it is due, is it for the computational
    math program whose due date is in early December?

    Best regards,
	   Jan
