Title: Groebner fans

Description:

The program is available from

    http://home.imf.au.dk/ajensen/software/gfan/gfan.html

Here is the abstract:

Gfan is a software package whose main function is to enumerate all reduced
Gröbner bases of a polynomial ideal. The reduced Gröbner bases yield the
maximal cones in the Gröbner fan of the ideal. Several subcomputations can be
issued and additional tools are included. Among these the highlights are:

    * commands for computing tropical varieties,
    * gfan_interactive which allows interactive walks on the edge graph of the state polytope of an ideal,
    * commands for graphical renderings of Gröbner fans and monomial ideals.

Mike started writing an interface to the gfan program, which we could
distribute with M2.  See his half written M2 package in
M2/Macaulay2/packages/gfanInterface.m2.

Dan should be involved in planning for making interfaces to other programs
consistent.

Janko Boehm (Saarbruecken) as a PostDoc might be possible choice of
implementer.  [suggested by Frank]

Progress log:

March, 2008: Michael Stillman, Josephine Yu, and Anders Jensen worked a bit on
this.  Gwyn Whieldon might also be interested in working on this.

March, 2009: Andrew Hoefel has been interface to gfan lately, and the code is
in progess.
