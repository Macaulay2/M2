  There are many people contributing to Macaulay2 development, and we welcome help!
  This directory contains descriptions of projects that need doing, together with
  an indication of whether anyone is working on them currently. 
</p>

<p>
  If a project sounds interesting, before embarking on it talk to us and we'll
  register your interest and plans here.    Check the <b>Project
  assigned to</b> and <b>Current status</b> fields in the project description,
  to see whether the project is unassigned or quiescent.
</p>

<p>
  If you have a new project to propose, advertise it on the 
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/macaulay2">Macaulay2 google group</a>
  to find out if anyone else is thinking about it.  We may then ask you to
  write it up using this <a href="TEMPLATE">template file</a>, so we can add it
  to the list here.
