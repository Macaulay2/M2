Macaulay2 is a system for computing in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry
and related fields.  The system was originally written by Dan Grayson and Mike
Stillman.  David Eisenbud joined the project a number of years ago, and many
users are writing packages for the system, and some are contributing source
code.
