simplify
m:matrix n:int >> matrix
Simplify the columns of the matrix 'm' in a way depending on the number 'n': if n=1, remove zero columns. if n=2, remove elements which are scalar multiples of others, and zeros, if n=3, remove columns which are divisible by other columns. Larger n will be possible as well: for example, one will be able to auto-reduce a set of columns, or remove monomial multiples, or replace with square-free elements.

ggskeleton
skeleton
r:res_comp >> .
Compute the skeleton of the resolution.  This is a debugging facility.  To see the number of pairs, use ggpairs after this, or grab the lead terms by using ggresNmap.

ggsortcolumns
sortcolumns
m:matrix degorder:int monorder:int>> intarray
Return an integer array giving the permutation of columns required to sort the columns of 'm'. The order used is determined from the signs of degorder, monorder: if degorder is positive (negative), then the columns are sorted into ascending (descending) degree order.  If degorder is 0, or for columns having the same degree, if monorder is positive (negative), then these columns are sorted in ascending (descending) monomial order.

ggstack
stack
. >> string
Push a string containing the types of the stack elements.

ggstats
stats
gb_comp >> .;  OR res_comp >> .
Return a string describing the state of the Groebner or resolution computation, and the number of s-pair and generator computations remaining in each degree.

ggSTRING
string
(string from input) >> string
Place a string on the stack.

ggsubmatrix
submatrix
rows:intarray cols:intarray M:matrix >> matrix
Return the matrix obtained from M by choosing the given rows and columns in the specified order.

ggsubmodule
submodule
F:freemodule rows:intarray >> freemodule
Return the freemodule obtained by taking the basis elements of F given by rows[0], rows[1], ... rows[length(rows)-1].

ggsubtract

a:var b:var >> var
Place a-b onto the stack.

ggsymm
symm
F:freemodule d:int >> freemodule;  OR m:matrix d:int >> matrix
Yields the d th symmetric power of the first argument.  Currently, the matrix argument must have only one row.

ggtensor
tensor
matrix matrix >> matrix
Return the tensor product ('outer' in Macaulay) of the two matrices.

ggterm
term
polyring a:ringelem m:monomial >> ringelem;  OR freemodule a:ringelem i:int >> vector
Create a polynomial from a coefficient and a monomial (first case), or create a vector from a ring element and an integer component (second case).

ggtermideal
termideal
m:matrix n:int >> termideal
Given a matrix defined over a ring R = Z[x1..xn]/I, create the termideal of lead terms which occur in the 'i'th row of this matrix.

ggtest
test
. >> .
Run some debugging code.  Internal use only.

ggtonet
tonet
var >> string
Place onto the stack a string representation of var suitable for dumping to a disk or network (using the command netsee).

ggtostring
tostring
var >> string
Place a reasonably readable string representation of the object onto the stack.

ggtracing
tracing
int >> int
Set the amount of tracing output done by GB routines (0 = none), and return on the stack the current tracing value.

ggtranspose
transpose
matrix >> matrix
Return the (graded) transpose of the given matrix.

ggtruncate

ggisunit
unit
f:ringelem >> int
If f is a unit, place 1 on the stack, else place a 0.

ggvar
var
xring v:int e:int >> ringelem
Place the monomial x^e onto the stack, where x is the v th variable in the given ring.

ggvector
vector
vecinfo f0:ringelem f2:ringelem ... f(r-1):ringelem >> vector
Create the vector f0 <0> + f1 <1> + ... + f(r-1) <r-1> using 'vecinfo'.

ggGF
GF
p:int n:int >> ring
Create the finite field having p^n elements, where p is a prime number.

ggZ
Z
. >> ring
Place the ring of integers onto the stack.

ggZn
Zn
n:int >> monoid
Yields the monoid Z^n, where each entry must fit into a machine integer.

ggzero

F:freemodule >> vector
Yields the zero vector of F.

ggzeromat
zeromat
rows:freemodule cols:freemodule >> matrix
Place the zero matrix cols --> rows onto the stack.  

ggzeromonoid
zeromonoid
. >> monoid
Returns the trivial monoid with a single element.
