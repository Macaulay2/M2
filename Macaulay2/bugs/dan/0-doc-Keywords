doc and documentation need a Keywords section.

Here are suggested keywords from users:


RationalPoints.m2: "solve"
showStructure: "Inheritance, Parent"
member: "inList, element"
%: "Normalform"


Probably what's needed is to support

	 \index{foo}

as done by Latex MakeIndex.  Then we could have construct a master index, and
have it searchable, and make it easily mergeable with packages that are
obtained from elsewhere by the user.
