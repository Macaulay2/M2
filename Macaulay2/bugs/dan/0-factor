Hi Dan,
factory assumes only, that the minimal polynomial of the field extension is
given as a irreducible polynomial.
(There is also another representation, which uses the root
of the multiplicative group, but we do not use it, so its untested.)

GCD:

    This one should now work in char 0 also:

	Here an example for gcd in a field extension of Z/p by mipo
	(a polynomial of type CanonicalForm):
	  setCharacteristic(p);
	  Variable a=rootOf(mipo);
	  // build F and G using a to represent a root of mipo
	  return gcd(F,G);

    This one should not be needed any longer:

	for extentions of Q:
	  setCharacteristic(0);
	  CFList as(mipo);
	  Variable a=rootOf(mipo);
	  // build F and G using a to represent a root of mipo
	  return  alg_gcd( F, G, as);

Factorization:

    And factorization of G:
      setCharacteristic(p); // resp. setCharacteristic(0);
      Variable a=rootOf(mipo);
      // build G using a to represent a root of mipo
      CFFList L=Factorize(G, mipo);
