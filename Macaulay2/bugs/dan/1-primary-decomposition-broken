Also, the documentation for primaryDecomposition indicates that it should
work over a quotient ring.  However, one of the students found an example
from Atiyah McDonald (chapter 4, example 3, p. 51) that gives the wrong
answer.  Here is the example,

R=k[x,y,z]/(xy-z^2)
P=(x,z)

P^2 is not primary (z^2 = xy is in it, but neither x nor a power of y is
in P^2), but Macaulay2 says that it is primary.

Either the example (and my logic) in A/M is wrong, or there is trouble
with using primaryDecomposition over a quotient ring.  If this was never
meant to work, then that is fine, but then the documentation should
reflect that.
