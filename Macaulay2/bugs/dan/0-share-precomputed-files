This is basically ready to go.  We need to do an experiment where we make a fat
tar file and see how it goes, from scratch.

Also, we need to get rid of Macaulay2Doc/examples/ and the code that detects it

For sage and other builders of Macaulay2, it would be very nice if
./BUILD/share were to contain all the precomputed architecture independent
files normally built, so that we could include those files in a (bulky) source
distribution.  That would make the documentation for StatePolytope and
FourTiTwo uniform, i.e., the example output would be there, as run on some
other machine.
