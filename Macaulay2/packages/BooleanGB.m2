  Compute Groebner Basis in a Boolean Ring
Description
  Text
    gbBoolean is a fast Groebner Basis computation done bitwise instead of
    symbolically when working over the quotient ring F2/J where J is the ideal
    generated by X^2 - X .
  Example
    n = 3;
    R = ZZ/2[vars(0)..vars(n-1)];
    J = apply( gens R, x -> x^2 + x); 
    QR = R/J;
    I = ideal(a+b,b);
    gbBoolean I
    gens gb I
Caveat
  gbBoolean assumes the quotient ring, regardless of the ring in which the
  ideal was generated. 

  R = ZZ/2[x]

  gbBoolean ideal(x^3)
