			Installation of Macaulay 2

----------------------
1. Introduction
----------------------

Macaulay 2 is a software system for algebraic geometry research, written by
Daniel R. Grayson and Michael E. Stillman with support of the National
Science Foundation.

----------------------
2. Installation
----------------------

Make the files that are needed by runnning this command:

	setup

or
	./setup

if it's unix and '.' is not first on your path.  Then copy the shell script
bin/M2 (or bin/M2.bat if it's MSDOS or MS Windows) somewhere on your path
-- it contains the absolute path of the current directory -- and issue
the command

	M2

to start the program.  To see if it works, make a ring with

	R = ZZ/101[x,y,z]

and then make a resolution with

	res coker vars R

If you move the directory tree, just remove bin/M2 and start over.

One of the things that running 'setup' may do is to create a file called
bin/Macaulay2-XXXX.data, where XXXX is the name of your architecture as
provided by running 'uname -m'.  This feature is intended solely for Sun 4
machines, where the differences between certain pairs of architectures (e.g.,
sun4d and sun4c) are slight enough that the same binary file bin/Macaulay2
will work on both, but the bin/Macaulay2-XXXX.data files will differ enough
so that the program will not work if you try to replace one by the other.  If
you have both sun4c machines and sun4d machines, you can run 'setup' on each
of these in the same directory tree.

2.1. Notes on Windows 95 installation
------------------------------------------------------------------

    After unpacking, check to ensure that there are less than a dozen files
    in this directory.  If not, perhaps you have unzipped the distribution
    file using PKUNZIP and forgotten to specify -d on the command line,
    thereby failing to recover the subdirectory structure of the
    distribution.  If so, then you should start over.

    If you used PKUNZIP to unpack the files, or if you are running under
    Windows 3.1, then the filenames were all truncated to 8+3 characters.
    This may cause problems during setup when trying to read files such as
    m2/underscore.m2.  In order to get the long file names under Windows 95,
    you should use "PKZIP for Windows" from PKWare at http://www.pkware.com
    or "WinZip" from Nico Mak Computing at http://www.winzip.com to unpack
    the file.  Alternatively, to settle for short file names, you can edit
    the batch files SETUP.BAT and BIN\M2.BAT and change LFN=Y to LFN=N.  (The
    symbol LFN stands for Long File Names.)

    We have not tested this yet under MSDOS.  You will need a DPMI extended
    memory manager, such as CSDPMI, available at our web site.  Assuming you
    can get it to work, then if you switch from MSDOS to WINDOWS 95, or vice
    versa, you will have to run SETUP again, for the *.DAT files will differ.

    There is a way to run Macaulay 2 and retain the output after it scrolls
    off the screen.  Run M2 in the text editor EPSILON with the command
    'start-process'.  It works fine!  EPSILON is available for trial from
    Lugaru Software at http://lugaru.com/epsinfo.html.  We also have our own
    interface under development for you.

3. The manual
----------------------

The manual is available in various forms, and includes tutorials as
well as descriptions of each function.

A. While running Macaulay 2.

    While running Macaulay2, on-line help is available on 
    predefined functions and types, and other topics.  For example,
    'help Matrix' gives information about matrices, and
    'help matrix' describes the 'matrix' command.

    Also useful is the 'apropos' command: 'apropos "Matrix"' will return
    a list containing all identifiers containing the string "Matrix".
    One caveat: it is case sensititive, so that for example the 'matrix'
    routine will not appear on the list.

B. With netscape

    The directory 'html' contains the documentation in HTML form.  You
    may view it with the command 'netscape html/index.html'.

C. In book form

    The directory 'book' contains the code for creating the book form of
    the documentation, in TeX.  But if you don't have gnu make you might
    want to just down load the dvi files for the book from the web site -
    the file is M2book.dvi, or M2hbook.dvi if you want the HyperTeX
    version viewable with xhdvi.

----------------------
4. Other documentation
----------------------

The file emacs/emacs.hlp gives a brief tutorial introduction to the use of
emacs with Macaulay 2, and includes some lines of emacs code to put into your
.emacs file.  One nice feature of emacs' Macaulay 2 mode is command
completion.

Read the file CHANGES to see what changes have been made since the last
version you used.

See the file licenses/README for information about copyright and licenses for
the program, its code, and the libraries it uses.
